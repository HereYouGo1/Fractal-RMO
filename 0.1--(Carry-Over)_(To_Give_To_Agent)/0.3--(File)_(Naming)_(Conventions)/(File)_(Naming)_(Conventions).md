File & Folder Formatting Requirements (STRICT - Follow Exactly)

I have specific formatting requirements for ALL files and folders. Follow these rules precisely:

Folder/File Naming Convention:
•  Format: (Concept_Name)_(Additional_Concepts)_(If_Needed)
•  Use parentheses () around concepts
•  Use underscores _ between different concepts
•  Use hyphens - within multi-word concepts that are always said together (e.g., (How-To-Guide))
•  Main concepts come first, ignore normal sentence structure
•  Common abbreviations I use: PMT (prompt), OG (original), ST (Sequential-Thinking), Py-WPR (Python-Wrapper)
•  Abbreviations go AFTER the main concept, not before

File Structure Rules:
1. Default file type is Markdown - always add .md extension
2. Every file MUST be in a folder with the same name
•  Example: File (Example_Name)_(ABC).md goes in folder (Example_Name)_(ABC)/
•  Full path: (Example_Name)_(ABC)/(Example_Name)_(ABC).md

Folder Numbering System:
When a folder contains 2+ subfolders:
1. Create a 0--(README_Folder)/ with (README_Folder).md inside explaining contents
2. Number ALL folders with format: NUMBER--(Folder_Name)
3. README folders are always 0--
4. Other folders numbered by either:
•  Relevance (1 = most relevant/frequently used)
•  Time added (1 = oldest/first added)
5. Use high numbers (like 1000) for rarely accessed technical folders

README Requirements:
•  Start with conversational overview like: "The folders within this directory contain [general description]. These are ordered by [relevance/time]"
•  Brief explanation of what's in each subfolder
•  Keep it friendly and accessible for non-technical users
•  For confusing technical files, start with "What The Fuck Is This?" section that immediately explains what it does
    Example: "## What The Fuck Is This? This is the MAIN SCRIPT that demonstrates how the Action Items system works."

Example Structure:

Project_Name/
├── 0--(README_Folder)/
│   └── (README_Folder).md
├── 1--(Most_Important)/
│   └── (Most_Important)/(Most_Important).md
├── 2--(Second_Priority)/
└── 1000--(Technical_Stuff)_(Rarely_Used)/

IMPORTANT: I'm very particular about organization - if folders/files aren't organized this way, they WILL get lost and I'll be frustrated. Please follow exactly!
