## Current Status

✅ Environment setup complete (Python, Docker, dependencies)
✅ Documentation system created
❌ Agent code not started yet
⚠️ Need to add real API keys to .env file

## How To Use

1. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source 11--(Python)_(Virtual)_(Environment)/venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Check Docker databases are running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
