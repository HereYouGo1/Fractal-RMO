# PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

Track real-world LLM limitations discovered during development. These become data points for the Fractal-RMO system to learn from. Each entry should document:
- What failed
- Why it failed  
- Workaround used
- Pattern to watch for


======================================================================

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
[Describe the failure]

**ROOT CAUSE:**
[Why it failed]

**WORKAROUND:**
[How you fixed/avoided it]

**PATTERN:**

# DISCOVERED LIMITATIONS

### Package Compatibility Assumptions
**Date Discovered:** 2025-08-31
**Agent:** Claude
**Category:** Knowledge Cutoff

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
Assumed asyncpg 0.28.0 would work with Python 3.13.7

**ROOT CAUSE:**
LLM training data doesn't include latest compatibility issues. Python 3.13 is newer than training cutoff.

**WORKAROUND:**
Upgraded to asyncpg 0.30.0 after compilation failed

**PATTERN:**
LLMs will suggest package versions from their training data without knowing current compatibility


----------------------------------------------------------------------


### Path Handling with Special Characters
**Date Discovered:** 2025-08-31  
**Agent:** Claude
**Category:** String Processing

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
Paths with parentheses like `11--(Python)_(Virtual)_(Environment)` require quotes in terminal commands

**ROOT CAUSE:**
LLMs often forget shell interprets parentheses as special characters

**WORKAROUND:**
Always quote paths or escape special characters

**PATTERN:**
LLMs generate "clean" commands without considering shell interpretation


----------------------------------------------------------------------


### Context Window Resource Management
**Date Discovered:** 2025-08-31
**Agent:** Claude
**Category:** Context Window

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
Single large documentation file would eventually blow context window

**ROOT CAUSE:**
LLMs don't proactively manage their own context consumption

**WORKAROUND:**
Segment documentation into multiple focused files

**PATTERN:**
LLMs will happily create infinitely growing documents until context fails


----------------------------------------------------------------------


### Working Directory Assumptions
**Date Discovered:** 2025-08-31
**Agent:** Claude  
**Category:** State Management

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
Commands assuming wrong working directory after navigation

**ROOT CAUSE:**
LLMs lose track of current directory state across multiple commands

**WORKAROUND:**
Use absolute paths or explicit `cd` before each operation

**PATTERN:**
LLMs forget stateful changes like directory navigation

# PATTERN CATEGORIES EMERGING

## 1. Knowledge Cutoff Issues
- Package versions
- New Python features
- Latest best practices

## 2. Context Management
- Window size limitations
- State tracking across conversation
- File content retention

## 3. Shell/System Interaction  
- Special character handling
- Path interpretation
- Command sequencing

## 4. Assumption Failures
- Environment state
- User's system configuration
- Previous action results

# NOTES FOR FRACTAL-RMO IMPLEMENTATION

These limitations represent real failure modes to build detection for:

1. **Version Compatibility Checker**
   - Detect when suggesting potentially incompatible versions

2. **Context Window Monitor**
   - Track consumption and warn before overflow

3. **Shell Command Validator**
   - Check for special characters needing escape

4. **State Tracking System**
   - Maintain awareness of directory, environment changes

Each limitation here is a future test case for the system.
