# TRUNK-BRANCH DOCUMENTATION - FIXES APPLIED
## Complete List of Corrections Made to All Four Documents

[Created: 2025-09-01 | 20:50 EST | By: Claude-4.1-Opus]


------------------------------------------------------

## What The Fuck Is This?

This document explains EVERY fix I made to the trunk-branch documentation based on Chris's feedback and the conversation with the previous agent.

• **Main Issue:** Previous agent added fake implementation instead of documenting system design
• **Secondary Issue:** Naming conventions not followed (missing underscores)
• **Result:** All documents now properly document the DESIGN, not fake implementations


------------------------------------------------------

## KEY CORRECTIONS APPLIED

### 1. Removed ALL Token-Based References

**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
The documents still had references to "token-based" branches and token calculations for determining branch scope.

**WHAT I FIXED:**
• Changed "token-based (sub-branches)" to "deliverable-based (sub-branches)"
• Removed all token calculation sections
• Emphasized branches are scoped by deliverables throughout
• Made it clear: Main branch = major system component, Sub-branch = specific deliverable

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Chris was crystal clear - branches are based on what they deliver, not how many tokens they use. Multiple agents can work through 20 sessions if needed to complete a deliverable.


------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Fixed All Folder Naming Issues

**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
• Used `0.2--(O-F)` instead of `0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)`
• Missing underscores between words in folder names
• Inconsistent naming throughout documents

**WHAT I FIXED:**
• ALL instances now use `0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)` with proper underscores
• Fixed in directory structures, paths, commands, everywhere
• Ensured Chris's naming conventions are followed exactly

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Chris is very particular about organization. Wrong naming = lost files and frustration.


------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Documented System DESIGN Not Fake Implementation

**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
Previous agent created fake examples like:
```
## Approved:
- A-1: Base agents [Created]
- A-2: Error handling [Created]
```
This makes it look like these branches already exist when they don't.

**WHAT I FIXED:**
Changed to explain the DESIGN of the system:
```
## How the System Would Track Propositions:
[Explanation of tracking design]

## Example of how tracking would look:
[Branch-ID]: [Description] - [Status] - [Date]
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Documentation should explain how the system will work, not pretend it's already implemented. Chris needs to understand the design, not be confused by fake data.


------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Clarified Sub-Branch Propositions System

**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
The propositions system was shown as if branches were already approved and created, with specific examples like "A-4: Gemini Integration" that weren't real.

**WHAT I FIXED:**
• Explained propositions as a SYSTEM DESIGN
• Used placeholder format: `[Proposed Sub-Branch Name]: [Brief Description]`
• Clarified this is where agents PROPOSE ideas, not where approved branches live
• Emphasized 4-5 sentence format for explaining deliverables

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Agents need to understand they're proposing deliverables for Chris to review, not creating branches themselves.


------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Properly Documented Dependency Chain System

**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
The dependency chain system wasn't clearly explained with Chris's exact E7→A6→C4 example throughout.

**WHAT I MAINTAINED/EMPHASIZED:**
• Used Chris's exact example consistently
• Explained lazy update strategy clearly
• Showed blocked message format when dependencies outdated
• Clarified update agent only needs O-F files, not full context

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
This is the core innovation - updates cascade ONLY when needed, not automatically. Saves massive amounts of work.


------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Master Timestamp Log Properly Explained

**WHAT I ENSURED:**
• Single master log replaces ALL individual branch timestamp logs
• Located at `0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/0.2--(Master)_(Timestamp)_(Log)/`
• Lists ALL sub-branches in order (A-1, A-2, A-3... B-1, B-2...)
• Removed all references to individual branch logs

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
One source of truth for all timestamps. No checking multiple logs. Efficiency.


------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Git Integration Emphasis

**WHAT I EMPHASIZED:**
• EVERY update needs a git commit prompt
• Not just trunk changes - ALL changes
• Chris doesn't know git well, needs prompts for everything

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
Frequent commits = nothing lost, rollback points available.


------------------------------------------------------

## VALIDATION OF FIXES

### Documents Updated:
✅ Architecture - Removed token refs, fixed terminology
✅ Structure - Fixed ALL folder naming issues
✅ Operations - Clarified system design vs implementation
✅ Advanced - Fixed proposition tracking to show design not fake data

### Key Decisions Preserved:
✅ Deliverable-based branches (not tokens)
✅ Master timestamp log (not individual logs)
✅ Lazy update strategy with dependency chains
✅ Sub-branch propositions for agent ideas
✅ Git prompts after EVERY update
✅ Branches remain after merging


------------------------------------------------------

## WHAT STILL NEEDS DECISIONS (PENCILED ITEMS)

These remain for Chris to decide:

1. **Context Analysis Guidelines** - Exact rules for RELEVANT vs NOT RELEVANT
2. **Synchronization Agent Frequency** - How often to run
3. **Git Integration Strategy** - How git branches relate to doc branches
4. **Validation Requirements** - What checks before trunk updates
5. **Check-off System Implementation** - File-based vs database


------------------------------------------------------

## WHY THESE FIXES MATTER

The previous agent mixed documentation of the system DESIGN with fake implementation examples. This created confusion about what exists vs what's planned.

Now the documents clearly explain:
• HOW the system will work (design)
• WHY each feature exists (reasoning)
• WHAT decisions have been made (locked in)
• WHAT still needs deciding (penciled)

The system is ready for Chris to review the remaining decisions and begin implementation.
