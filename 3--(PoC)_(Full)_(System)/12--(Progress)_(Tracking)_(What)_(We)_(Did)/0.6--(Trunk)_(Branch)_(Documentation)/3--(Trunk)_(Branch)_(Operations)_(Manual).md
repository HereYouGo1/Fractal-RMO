------------------------------------------------------

## What The Fuck Is This?

This document explains EXACTLY how agents work within the trunk-branch system - from login to logout, including all update procedures, branch creation, and synchronization.

‚Ä¢ **Step-by-step workflows** - No ambiguity about what to do
‚Ä¢ **Common scenarios** - See exactly how things work in practice
‚Ä¢ **Update cascading** - Understand what updates where and when


------------------------------------------------------

## Agent Login Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Context Load

**Agent receives:**
```
1. Personality documents (Chris's style guide)
2. File naming conventions
3. Contribution guidelines (updated for trunk-branch)
4. Trunk O-F file
5. Branch assignment (e.g., "You're working on A-1")
```

### Step 2: Dependency Chain Check

**Agent checks Git for dependency updates:**
```bash
# Check when dependencies last updated
git log --grep="O-F" --oneline --since="last-sync"
```

**WHY this matters:**
Git commit history tells you when EVERY sub-branch last updated. Without checking this, you might work with outdated context and create inconsistencies.

**Agent checks dependency chain:**
If working on E-7, check its O-F file (O-F = Overview File - the main documentation for each branch):
```markdown
## Dependency Chain:
Direct dependencies: A-6
A-6 depends on: C-4
Full chain: E-7 ‚Üí A-6 ‚Üí C-4
```

**Agent compares timestamps:**
‚Ä¢ E-7 last synced with A-6: 12:00 EST (from E-7's O-F)
‚Ä¢ A-6 last updated: 12:00 EST (from master log)
‚Ä¢ C-4 last updated: 17:00 EST (from master log)
‚Ä¢ **PROBLEM:** C-4 updated AFTER A-6's last sync!

### Step 3: Blocked or Proceed Decision

**If dependencies are outdated (like E-7 example above):**
```
üî¥ STARTUP BLOCKED - Dependency Chain Issue

E-7 cannot proceed because:
‚Ä¢ E-7 depends on A-6 (last synced: 12:00 EST)
‚Ä¢ A-6 depends on C-4 (updated: 17:00 EST) 
‚Ä¢ A-6 needs update from C-4 first

To resolve:
1. Run update agent on A-6, or
2. Manually update A-6 with C-4's context

Current chain: E-7 ‚Üí A-6 [OUTDATED] ‚Üí C-4 [CURRENT]
```

**WHY lazy updates matter:**
Instead of updating A-6 and E-7 every time C-4 changes, we wait until someone actually needs them. This prevents doing 30 updates when C-4 changes 6 times in a day.

### Step 4: Work Continuation

**Agent reads work history index:**
```
Path: 2--(A-1)_(Sub_Bnch)_(O-F)/(A-1)_(Work)_(History)_(Index).md
```

**Determines where to continue:**
‚Ä¢ Last work history entry
‚Ä¢ Outstanding tasks from O-F
‚Ä¢ Dependencies that are now unblocked


------------------------------------------------------

## Update Procedures

### Updating Sub-Branch O-F (NEW TASK-BASED STRUCTURE)

**Every work session updates the task tracking system:**

```markdown
# (A-1)_(Sub_Bnch)_(O-F).md

## DELIVERABLE DEFINITION
[One clear sentence defining what this sub-branch produces]

## MASTER TASK BREAKDOWN

### Task 1: [Major Component] [‚úÖ COMPLETE or ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS or üìã PLANNED]
**Sub-tasks:**
- 1.1 [Specific implementation] [‚úÖ or üîÑ CURRENT or üìã]
  Summary: [What was built/decided if complete]
  Insight: üí° [Any gotcha or important discovery]
- 1.2 [Another sub-task] [Status]
  Summary: [Brief outcome if complete]

### Task 2: [Next Major Component] [Status]
**Sub-tasks:**
[Same structure...]

## DEPENDENCY CHAIN
Direct dependencies: [Which branches this needs]
[Branch] depends on: [Its dependencies]
Full chain: [Complete dependency tree]
Last sync commit: [Git commit hash when last checked dependencies]

## SHARED CONTEXT SOURCES
- [Branch-ID]: [What was imported] [Date/Time]
  * [How it's being used]
  * [Any adaptations made]

## SHORT-TERM MEMORY (Recent Work)
Entry 3: [Most recent work item]
Entry 2: [Previous work]
Entry 1: [Older work]
```

**WHY This Structure:**
‚Ä¢ Tasks = Long-term memory (what's been done)
‚Ä¢ Progress indicators = Current position
‚Ä¢ Summaries = Quick context without reading work files
‚Ä¢ Insights = Attached to relevant work
‚Ä¢ Dependencies = Clear tracking with Git commit hash

### Updating Main Branch O-F

**Main branch SHORT-TERM MEMORY:**
```markdown
Entry 3: A-1 active - Working on base agents
Entry 2: A-2 complete - Error handling done
Entry 1: A-3 planned - Routing system next
```

**Git commit for tracking updates:**
```bash
# Commit your O-F changes with proper message
git add "*O-F*.md"
git commit -m "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d'): A-1: Updated O-F"

# Now the timestamp is tracked in Git history
```

**NOTE:** Master Timestamp Log DEPRECATED (Decision: 2025-09-04)
All timestamps tracked via Git commit history.

### Updating Trunk O-F

**CONDITIONS for trunk update:**
1. Tech spec change (needs verification)
2. Project-wide insight discovered
3. Branch status change (complete/blocked/active)
4. New dependency identified

**Trunk SHORT-TERM MEMORY update:**
```markdown
Entry 3: Branch A-1 active - Base agents in progress
[Only pointers, no details]
```

**Trunk LONG-TERM MEMORY update:**
```markdown
## Branch A (Agent System)
- Status: Active
- Progress: A-1 (80%), A-2 (complete)
- Dependencies: Blocks C
- Notes: Consider different LLM providers
```

**Trunk INSIGHTS update (only if project-wide):**
```markdown
üí° **Docker networking breaks with VPN**
- Containers can't reach each other when VPN active
- Solution: Disconnect VPN or use host networking
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Branch Creation Protocol

### Step 1: Determine If New Branch Needed

**Main Branch Creation Triggers:**
‚Ä¢ New major system component or domain (Agents, API, Database)
‚Ä¢ Logical grouping of related functionality
‚Ä¢ Organizational clarity

**Sub-Branch Creation Triggers:**
‚Ä¢ New deliverable within the domain
‚Ä¢ One clear objective that can be completed
‚Ä¢ Produces something testable/verifiable

**CRITICAL DECISION (2025-09-01):** 
Branches based on DELIVERABLES, not tokens!
- Main branch = Major system component
- Sub-branch = Specific deliverable
- Continue in same sub-branch if work relates to deliverable
- New sub-branch ONLY for genuinely new deliverable

### Step 2: Propose Sub-Branch in Propositions Sheet

**Location:** `[Main_Branch]/0.2--(Sub-Bnch)_(Propositions)/(Sub-Bnch)_(Propositions).md`

**What This Is:**
A document where agents write proposals for new sub-branches they think are needed. This prevents agents from creating random sub-branches and gives Chris visibility into what's being considered.

**Format for propositions (4-5 sentences explaining the deliverable):**
```markdown
### [Proposed Sub-Branch Name]: [Brief Description]  
**Proposed by:** [Agent identifier] on [Date/Time]
**Why needed:** [4-5 sentences explaining: What specific deliverable this will create. Why it's a separate deliverable from existing sub-branches. What problem it solves or capability it adds. How it fits within the main branch's domain. Any dependencies or relationships to other sub-branches.]
**Notes:** [Optional additional context that might help Chris decide]
```

**Example Format (not real branch):**
```markdown
### X-4: Error Recovery System
**Proposed by:** Agent working on X-3 on 2025-09-01 | 14:30 EST
**Why needed:** This sub-branch would create a complete error recovery system as a distinct deliverable. While X-2 handles basic error catching, recovery involves retry logic, fallback strategies, and state restoration which is a separate concern. This deliverable would produce a tested recovery module that other branches could use. It needs to be separate from X-2 because recovery strategies are independent of error detection.
**Notes:** Discovered need while working on X-3 when transient failures kept breaking the workflow.
```

**WHY propositions matter:**
Agents capture ideas without getting distracted. Chris reviews during planning. Nothing gets lost.

**NOTE:** Branch creation authority = Agents propose, Chris decides (Decision: 2025-09-01)

### Step 3: Complete Context Analysis Protocol

**CRITICAL:** This protocol runs BEFORE any coding begins and whenever new needs are discovered.

## Task Analysis Protocol (BEFORE Starting Work)

### When This Triggers
**MANDATORY:** Before starting ANY sub-task implementation
**CRITICAL:** This prevents 95% of mid-task discoveries if done THOROUGHLY

### The Analysis Process (EXHAUSTIVE - Not Half-Assed)

```markdown
TASK: [What I'm about to implement]

## 1. FORCED DECOMPOSITION (Chris's Requirement)
- Break into MICRO-STEPS (not vague components):
  * Step 1: [Exact action, e.g., "Create error class"]
  * Step 2: [Exact action, e.g., "Add retry decorator"]
  * Step 3: [Each step should be 5-10 lines of code max]
- Patterns required:
  * [Specific pattern with implementation details]
- Data flow:
  * Input: [What comes in]
  * Processing: [What happens]
  * Output: [What goes out]

## 2. INTEGRATION POINT ANALYSIS (Critical)
- Where this touches other code:
  * [Branch X, line Y]: Will call this method
  * [Branch Z]: Needs this error type
  * [Branch W]: Shares this pattern
- Potential conflicts:
  * [What could break]
  * [What might be incompatible]

## 3. CONTEXT INVENTORY (What I Actually Have)
From my O-F:
- [Specific component, not "stuff from O-F"]

From my dependencies:
- [Exact import with version/timestamp]

From work history:
- [Specific implementation, file, line number]

## 4. GAP IDENTIFICATION (Be Paranoid)
Missing (check thoroughly!):
- [Component X doesn't exist - searched where?]
- [Pattern Y undefined - checked which branches?]
- [Decision Z needed - about what specifically?]

## 5. ASSUMPTION DOCUMENTATION (No Hidden Assumptions)
I'm assuming:
- [List EVERY assumption, even "obvious" ones]
- [E.g., "Auth tokens are strings"]
- [E.g., "Errors can be serialized to JSON"]
- [E.g., "Retry count is less than 10"]

Verified facts:
- [What I've actually confirmed]
- [Where I confirmed it]

## 6. RESOLUTION PLAN (Complete Before Coding)
- Import from [Branch] for [specific need]
- Build [component] locally because [reason]
- Research [unknown] before starting
- FLAG FOR CHRIS: [Specific decision needed]
```

**Why This THOROUGH Analysis Matters:**
Chris's insight: "If the code you're writing has to do with your plan already, then shouldn't you already know what those gaps are?"

The solution isn't mid-task checkpoints. It's making the upfront analysis ACTUALLY EXHAUSTIVE.

**Signs of Half-Assed Analysis (DON'T DO THIS):**
‚Ä¢ "I need error handling from A-2" (Too vague!)
‚Ä¢ "Import auth stuff from B-3" (What specifically?)
‚Ä¢ "Use retry pattern" (Which one? How?)

**Signs of PROPER Analysis:**
‚Ä¢ "Need BaseError class from A-2, lines 45-67, for inheritance"
‚Ä¢ "Import OAuth2 refresh method from B-3, not the full auth system"
‚Ä¢ "Use exponential backoff with 2^n seconds, max 3 retries, from B-3's pattern"

## THE CONTEXT ANALYSIS GATES SYSTEM

### When This Protocol Triggers

**Trigger Point 1: New Sub-Branch Creation**
```
Agent proposes A-3 ‚Üí Chris approves ‚Üí Create structure
‚Üí MUST RUN CONTEXT ANALYSIS before any work
```

**Trigger Point 2: Task Analysis Reveals Needs (MECHANICAL TRIGGER)**
```
Run THOROUGH Task Analysis Protocol (see above)
‚Üí Analysis reveals: "Need retry logic but don't have it"
‚Üí RUN CONTEXT ANALYSIS GATES to find it
‚Üí Import it if found, build it if not
```

**Note:** LLMs DON'T spontaneously realize needs - the Task Analysis Protocol FORCES discovery

**Trigger Point 3: Hitting a Blocker**
```
Can't proceed: "Need auth strategy but it doesn't exist"
‚Üí RUN PREREQUISITE PROCEDURE (Gate 0)
‚Üí Cannot continue until resolved
```

### The Gates System - Complete Details

#### GATE 0: Prerequisites Check
**What doesn't exist yet but I NEED to start?**

```markdown
Before you can even begin, list what's required:
‚Ä¢ "Need API specs defined" ‚Üí Do they exist? Check indexes
‚Ä¢ "Need database schema" ‚Üí Created yet? Scan branches
‚Ä¢ "Need auth strategy" ‚Üí Documented? Search propositions

If missing prerequisite found:
‚Üí STOP - Cannot proceed
‚Üí Document what's missing and why needed
‚Üí Either:
   1. Research and document it (no assumptions!)
   2. Propose new sub-branch to build it
   3. Ask Chris for the missing information

NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS - Get real answers
```

**Prerequisite Resolution Process:**
```markdown
When Gate 0 triggers:

1. Document in handoff file:
   ## BLOCKED - Missing Prerequisites
   - Need: Database schema for users
   - Why: Can't build user API without data structure
   - Searched: C branch (not found)
   - Proposed: C-5 for schema design

2. Check propositions sheet:
   Path: [Main_Branch]/0.2--(Sub-Bnch)_(Propositions)/
   - Maybe someone already proposed it?
   - Status: PROPOSED/APPROVED/REJECTED?

3. If not proposed, add proposition:
   ### C-5: Database Schema Design
   **Proposed by:** [Agent] on [Date/Time]
   **Why needed:** B-2 needs schema before building endpoints.
   This deliverable would define all tables, relationships,
   and constraints for the user management system.
   **Status:** PROPOSED [Awaiting Chris]

4. If research needed instead:
   - Document research requirements
   - Do the research (check docs, standards, etc.)
   - Document findings in work history
   - NO ASSUMPTIONS - only documented facts
```

#### GATE 1: Necessity Check
**What do I NEED to complete my deliverable?**

```markdown
Scan indexes to find what exists:

1. Check Main Branch Index:
   Path: 0.1--(Index)_(Main_Bnchs)/
   Quick scan: A=Agents, B=API, C=Database

2. Check relevant Sub-Branch Indexes:
   Path: [Branch]/0.1--(Index)_(Sub-Bnchs)/
   See deliverables: A-1 (base), A-2 (errors)

3. For promising branches, check Work History Index:
   Path: [Sub-Branch]/(X-N)_(Work)_(History)_(Index).md
   5-7 word summaries show what's built

List your NEEDS:
‚Ä¢ "Must have base class to extend"
‚Ä¢ "Must have auth logic for API calls"
‚Ä¢ "Must have user models"

If branch has something you NEED ‚Üí RELEVANT
Cannot complete without it ‚Üí RELEVANT
```

#### GATE 2: Optimization Check  
**What would make my deliverable BETTER?**

```markdown
While scanning, note optimizations:
‚Ä¢ "Logging would help debugging"
‚Ä¢ "Caching would improve performance"
‚Ä¢ "Retry logic would add resilience"

These aren't required but would improve quality.

If branch offers optimization ‚Üí RELEVANT (mark as optional)
Document why it would help
```

#### GATE 3: Duplication Check
**Does this already exist somewhere?**

```markdown
Before building ANYTHING:
1. Quick scan of all indexes
2. Check if another branch built it
3. Even partial implementations count

If it exists ‚Üí RELEVANT (import it)
Why build something twice? That's stupid.

Examples:
‚Ä¢ About to build retry logic? B-3 has it!
‚Ä¢ Creating error types? A-2 defined them!
‚Ä¢ Need logging? D already built it!
```

#### GATE 4: Uncertainty Check
**Not sure if something would help?**

```markdown
Can't decide if Branch X's feature Y is useful?

‚Üí FLAG FOR CHRIS:
"Chris, I'm building [deliverable].
Branch X has [feature Y].
Should I import it for [purpose]?"

Chris decides, not you.
This prevents bad architecture decisions.
```

### The Extraction Rules

**CORE PRINCIPLE:**
> "Extract ONLY what you cited as the reason for relevance."

```markdown
## How to Extract:

1. Look at WHY you marked it RELEVANT:
   - Said "need auth flow" ‚Üí Take ONLY auth flow
   - Said "need base class" ‚Üí Take ONLY class structure
   - Said "need models" ‚Üí Take ONLY model definitions

2. Leave behind:
   - Implementation details specific to that branch
   - Their domain-specific logic
   - Their test data
   - Their error messages
   - Anything NOT cited as needed

3. Document what you took:
   ## Shared Context Sources:
   - B-3: Auth flow sequence [2025-09-01 | 14:00 EST]
     * Took: OAuth2 flow steps
     * Left: Actual implementation
     * Why: Need the pattern, not the code
```

### Warning Signs (Smell Test)

```markdown
## üö® Over-importing Warning:
- Importing from >4 branches
- Context files getting huge
- Taking entire files instead of pieces
‚Üí Review with Chris

## üö® Under-importing Warning:
- Zero imports (unless truly standalone)
- Rebuilding existing solutions
- Spending hours on solved problems
‚Üí Re-run duplication check
```

### Complete Example: Creating A-3 (Error Recovery)

```markdown
## RUNNING CONTEXT ANALYSIS FOR A-3

### GATE 0 - Prerequisites:
Need: Error scenarios documented
Check: Scanning indexes... NOT FOUND
Action: Research common agent failures
[Research completed, documented in work history]
‚úì Gate 0 passed

### GATE 1 - Necessity:
Scanning for NEEDS:
‚Ä¢ Base agent structure ‚Üí A-1 has it ‚úì RELEVANT
‚Ä¢ Error types defined ‚Üí A-2 has them ‚úì RELEVANT
‚Ä¢ Must-have items found

### GATE 2 - Optimization:
Scanning for improvements:
‚Ä¢ Logging for errors ‚Üí D has patterns ‚úì RELEVANT (optional)
‚Ä¢ Retry for transient failures ‚Üí B-3 has logic ‚úì RELEVANT (optional)

### GATE 3 - Duplication:
About to build:
‚Ä¢ Error recovery system ‚Üí Checking... doesn't exist ‚úì
‚Ä¢ Retry mechanism ‚Üí Wait, B-3 has this! Import it

### GATE 4 - Uncertainty:
‚Ä¢ C-4 has caching... should failures be cached?
‚Üí ASKING CHRIS: "Should error recovery cache failed requests?"

### EXTRACTION PLAN:
FROM A-1:
- TAKE: Base class structure only
- LEAVE: Agent-specific methods
- REASON: Need skeleton to add recovery to

FROM A-2:
- TAKE: Error type definitions
- LEAVE: Error handling implementation
- REASON: Need types, not their handling

FROM B-3:
- TAKE: Retry logic pattern
- LEAVE: API-specific implementation
- REASON: Need approach, not specifics

FROM D (optional):
- TAKE: Logging interface
- LEAVE: Log formatting details
- REASON: Want consistent logging

### DOCUMENTING IN A-3 O-F:
## Shared Context Sources:

### Required Imports:
- A-1: Base agent class [2025-09-01 | 12:00 EST]
  * Extracted: Class structure only
- A-2: Error types [2025-09-01 | 11:00 EST]
  * Extracted: Type definitions

### Optional Imports:
- B-3: Retry patterns [2025-09-01 | 14:00 EST]
  * Extracted: Retry logic approach
- D: Logging [2025-09-01 | 09:00 EST]
  * Extracted: Logging interface

### Pending Chris Decision:
- C-4 caching for failed requests?

## Dependency Chain:
Direct dependencies: A-1, A-2, B-3, D
A-1 depends on: [none]
A-2 depends on: A-1
B-3 depends on: B-1
D depends on: [none]
Full chain: A-3 ‚Üí [A-1, A-2 ‚Üí A-1, B-3 ‚Üí B-1, D]
```

### Managing Dependencies

**IMPORTANT:** Mutual dependencies ARE allowed (Chris's clarification)
```markdown
A can need B while B needs A - this is fine!
System handles through:
‚Ä¢ Proper abstraction layers
‚Ä¢ Shared component branches
‚Ä¢ Clear bidirectional documentation

Not about preventing circles, but managing them.
```

### Step 4: Create Branch Structure (After Chris Approves)

```bash
# For new main branch B:
# cd = "change directory" (move to a folder)
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/3--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/0--(README_Folder)"
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/3--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/0.1--(Index)_(Sub-Bnchs)"
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/3--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/0.2--(Sub-Bnch)_(Propositions)"
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/3--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/1--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)"
# NOTE: No timestamp log folder - using master timestamp log instead

# For new sub-branch B-1:
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/3--(B)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/2--(B-1)_(Sub_Bnch)_(O-F)"

# Expected output: Folders created with no error messages
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Update Cascade Examples (Step-by-Step)

### Example: Update Flowing Up (Branch ‚Üí Trunk)

**Situation:** A-1 discovers Docker breaks with VPN active

```
Step 1: A-1 agent discovers issue
- Docker containers can't communicate when VPN active
- This affects B-2 which also uses Docker

Step 2: Update A-1's O-F
## Insights:
üí° **Docker breaks with VPN**
- Containers lose inter-communication
- Solution: Disconnect VPN or use host networking

Step 3: Evaluate scope
- Affects multiple branches? YES (B-2 uses Docker)
- Infrastructure issue? YES
- Project-wide impact? YES

Step 4: Promote to trunk
Update (Trunk)_(O-F).md:
## Session Insights:
üí° **Docker networking breaks with VPN**
- Affects all Docker-using branches
- Solution: Disconnect VPN during development

Step 5: Git commit prompt
"üü¢ GIT COMMIT: Added Docker-VPN conflict to trunk insights"
```

### Example: Update Flowing Down (Trunk ‚Üí Branch)

**Situation:** Trunk tech specs change Python version

```
Step 1: Trunk updated
- Python changed from 3.11 to 3.13
- New in Technical Setup section

Step 2: A-1 agent logs in next day
- Reads trunk O-F
- Compares with A-1's O-F tech specs
- Mismatch detected!

Step 3: Update A-1's tech specs
- Copy new Python version to A-1 O-F
- Check if affects A-1's work
- Update dependencies if needed

Step 4: Document update
In A-1 work history:
"Synchronized with trunk: Python 3.11 ‚Üí 3.13"

Step 5: Git commit prompt
"üü¢ GIT COMMIT: A-1 synchronized with trunk Python update"
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Common Scenarios (Complete Walkthroughs)

### Scenario 1: Creating New Sub-Branch

**Situation:** Need to create A-2 for error handling

**Steps:**
```
1. Agent working on A-1 identifies need for new deliverable
   - Error handling is separate deliverable from base classes
   - Will produce testable error management system
   
2. Add to propositions sheet:
   Path: 2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/0.2--(Sub-Bnch)_(Propositions)/
   - Write 4-5 sentence explanation with timestamp
   - Include why it's needed and what it delivers
   
3. Chris reviews and approves during planning
   
4. Create structure:
   mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/3--(A-2)_(Sub_Bnch)_(O-F)"
   
5. Create A-2 O-F with:
   - Objective: Add error handling to agents (deliverable)
   - Shared context: A-1 classes, D patterns
   - Dependency chain documented
   - Initial status: Planning
   
6. Update A's main O-F:
   - Add A-2 to sub-branch index
   - Update short-term memory
   
7. Update master timestamp log:
   - Add A-2 with initial timestamp
   
8. Git commit prompt:
   "üü¢ GIT COMMIT: Created A-2 sub-branch for error handling"
```

### Scenario 2: Branch Needs External Context

**Situation:** A-1 needs B-3's authentication logic

**Steps:**
```
1. During A-1 work, realize need for auth

2. Check Master Timestamp Log for B-3's last update:
   Path: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/0.2--(Master)_(Timestamp)_(Log)/
   - B-3: 2025-09-01 | 14:00 EST
   
3. Read B-3's O-F for relevant sections
   
4. In A-1's O-F, add to dependency chain:
   ## Dependency Chain:
   Direct dependencies: B-3
   B-3 depends on: [check B-3's O-F]
   
   ## Shared Context Sources:
   - B-3: Auth logic [Timestamp: 2025-09-01 | 14:00 EST]
   
5. Extract needed parts from B-3

6. Continue work with context

7. On next login, check master log:
   - If B-3 updated after 14:00 EST, review changes
   - Update A-1 if needed
   
8. Git commit after adding dependency:
   "üü¢ GIT COMMIT: A-1 added B-3 auth dependency"
```

### Scenario 3: Two Branches Merge

**Situation:** C and F merge into C-F

**Steps:**
```
1. Complete individual objectives of C and F
2. Identify overlap/integration needs
3. Create new C-F main branch:
   mkdir -p ".../5--(C-F)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)"
   
4. In C-F O-F:
   ## Origin:
   - Merged from C (cache) and F (frontend)
   - Original branches remain for reference
   
5. Parse relevant work from C and F:
   - Take final implementations
   - Combine insights
   - Merge dependencies
   
6. Update trunk:
   - Long-term memory shows C-F exists
   - Note C and F can still be developed independently
   
7. Original C and F remain intact for:
   - Historical reference
   - Independent future development
   - Rollback if needed
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Update Cascading Rules

### What Updates Flow Up (Branch ‚Üí Trunk)

**Always flows up:**
‚Ä¢ Tech specification changes
‚Ä¢ Project-blocking issues
‚Ä¢ Completed milestones
‚Ä¢ New dependencies discovered

**Requires verification before flowing up:**
‚Ä¢ Architecture changes
‚Ä¢ Database schema modifications
‚Ä¢ API contract changes
‚Ä¢ Security-related updates

**Stays in branch:**
‚Ä¢ Implementation details
‚Ä¢ Local optimizations
‚Ä¢ Branch-specific workarounds
‚Ä¢ Work progress details

### What Updates Flow Down (Trunk ‚Üí Branch)

**Always flows down:**
‚Ä¢ Tech spec changes
‚Ä¢ Project description updates
‚Ä¢ New project-wide insights
‚Ä¢ Dependency changes

**Checked on login:**
‚Ä¢ All trunk changes since last session
‚Ä¢ Related branch updates (if using shared context)
‚Ä¢ Timestamp logs for context sources


------------------------------------------------------

## Git Integration Procedures

### Git Strategy - FINALIZED DECISION

**Architecture Decision:** Single Git branch (master/main)
‚Ä¢ All documentation branches exist as folders
‚Ä¢ NO separate Git branches for documentation
‚Ä¢ Simple, visible, no branch switching

### Two-Commit Workflow (REQUIRED)

**The Problem:** 
When committing everything together, diffs show work history changes mixed with O-F updates, creating noise.

**The Solution:**
Two separate commits per work session:

```bash
# COMMIT 1: Work files
git add "[work_history_folder]/*" "[implementation_files]"
git commit -m "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d'): A-1: Implementation work"

# Update your O-F file with progress

# COMMIT 2: O-F file only  
git add "*O-F*.md"
git commit -m "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d'): A-1: Updated O-F"
git push origin master
```

### Dependency Checking via Git

**Old Way (Master Timestamp Log):**
‚Ä¢ Check central log file
‚Ä¢ See when each branch updated
‚Ä¢ 20 dependencies = reading massive file

**New Way (Git-powered):**
```bash
# See all O-F updates across project
git log --grep="O-F" --oneline --since="2025-09-01"

# Check specific dependency changes
git diff [last-sync-commit] HEAD -- "path/to/dependency/O-F.md"
```

**Each O-F stores:**
```markdown
Last sync commit: abc123def
```

**Benefits at Scale:**
‚Ä¢ 5 dependencies: Check via Git = 100 tokens vs 3,000 tokens
‚Ä¢ 20 dependencies: Check via Git = 200 tokens vs 15,000 tokens!

### When to Prompt for Git Commit (EVERY UPDATE!)

**Chris's Rule:** "Every update (not only the ones that change the otherwise permanent areas) should have the agent prompt me to do a git commit"

**ALWAYS prompt after:**
‚Ä¢ ANY update to trunk O-F
‚Ä¢ ANY update to branch O-F  
‚Ä¢ ANY update to sub-branch O-F
‚Ä¢ ANY work history entry
‚Ä¢ ANY README update
‚Ä¢ Before switching branches
‚Ä¢ Before ending session

**WHY prompt for everything?**
Chris said "I don't know much about Git" - frequent commits ensure nothing is lost and provide rollback points if something breaks.

**Prompt message format:**
```
üü¢ GIT COMMIT NEEDED

Changes made:
- [Specific file/update 1]
- [Specific file/update 2]

Suggested commit:
git add -A && git commit -m "[Branch]: [Action] [Component]"

Run this? (or modify message)
```

**Example prompt:**
```
üü¢ GIT COMMIT NEEDED

Changes made:
- Updated A-1 sub-branch O-F with progress
- Added work history entry for implementation
- Updated timestamp log in branch A

Suggested commit:
git add -A && git commit -m "A-1: Implement base agent class"

Run this? (or modify message)
```

### Commit Message Conventions

**Format:**
```
[BRANCH]: [Action] [Component]

Body:
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

Affects: [Dependencies]
```

**Example:**
```
A-1: Add base agent class with OpenAI

- Created agent.py with base class
- Added OpenAI integration
- Includes error handling

Affects: A-2 will build on this
```

**üîî PENCILED: Full git strategy TBD**


------------------------------------------------------

## Work History Management

### Creating Work History Entries

**When to create new work history file:**
‚Ä¢ Starting new phase of work
‚Ä¢ Major milestone reached
‚Ä¢ Switching focus within sub-branch
‚Ä¢ After significant debugging session

**Work history naming (EXAMPLES - use descriptive names):**
```
1--(A-1)_(Setup)_(Initial)/
2--(A-1)_(Implementation)_(Core)/
3--(A-1)_(Testing)_(Debug)/
4--(A-1)_(Documentation)_(Final)/
```

**IMPORTANT:** These are example names - use whatever describes the actual work

### Updating Work History Index

**After each work history addition:**
```markdown
# In (A-1)_(Work)_(History)_(Index).md

## Work History:
1. **Setup Initial** - Environment and dependencies configured
2. **Implementation Core** - Built base agent class with methods
3. **Testing Debug** - Fixed connection issues and error handling
4. **Documentation Final** - Added docstrings and usage examples
```

**Index should be scannable:**
‚Ä¢ 5-7 word descriptions
‚Ä¢ Clear progression visible
‚Ä¢ Easy to find specific work


------------------------------------------------------

## Agent Handoff Procedures

### When Switching Agents

**Exiting agent must:**
1. Complete all documentation updates
2. Update the handoff file
3. Run validator script
4. Prompt for git commit
5. Output summary with handoff file location

### Handoff File Management

**Location:** `(A-1)_(Handoff)_(Status).md` in each sub-branch folder

**Template for Handoff File:**
```markdown
# HANDOFF STATUS - Branch A-1
[Last Updated: 2025-09-01 | 22:30 EST | By: Claude-4.1-Opus]

## CURRENT STATUS
**Phase:** Implementation complete, testing started
**Completion:** ~75% of deliverable

## WORK COMPLETED THIS SESSION
‚Ä¢ Created base agent class structure
‚Ä¢ Implemented OpenAI integration
‚Ä¢ Added error handling framework
‚Ä¢ Started unit test suite

## NEXT STEPS
1. Finish remaining unit tests
2. Add retry logic for API calls
3. Implement logging system
4. Test with real API keys

## ACTIVE BLOCKERS
‚Ä¢ **Missing API Keys:** Need real OpenAI/Anthropic keys in .env
‚Ä¢ **Awaiting Decision:** Chris to confirm retry limit (3 or 5?)
‚Ä¢ **Dependency Update:** B-3 auth module needs completion first

## DEPENDENCIES
‚Ä¢ Imports from B-3: Authentication [Last checked: 14:00 EST]
‚Ä¢ Imports from C-1: Database models [Current as of: 10:00 EST]

## NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT
‚Ä¢ Watch for rate limiting on OpenAI calls
‚Ä¢ The async handler is tricky - see comments in code
‚Ä¢ Chris prefers 3 retries based on Discord discussion
```

**Update Frequency:** 
‚Ä¢ At end of EVERY work session
‚Ä¢ When hitting a major blocker
‚Ä¢ Before any agent switch

### New Agent Onboarding

**New agent receives:**
1. Standard base documents
2. Trunk O-F
3. Specific branch O-F files
4. **Handoff file from sub-branch** (CRITICAL)
5. Work history for context

**First action:** Read handoff file to understand current state


------------------------------------------------------

## Error Recovery Procedures

### If Updates Conflict

**Scenario:** Two agents updated trunk simultaneously

**Recovery:**
1. Check git history for conflicts
2. Identify which updates are valid
3. Merge non-conflicting changes
4. Re-run synchronization
5. Document issue in LLM Limitations

### If Context Sharing Breaks

**Scenario:** A-1 has outdated B-3 context

**Recovery:**
1. Check B's timestamp log
2. Read current B-3 O-F
3. Identify what changed
4. Update A-1's context references
5. Review A-1 work for impacts
6. Document any required changes


------------------------------------------------------

## üîî PENCILED ITEMS - Operations Decisions

### Synchronization Frequency
**What needs deciding:** How often should agents check for updates?
**Options:** Every login, hourly, after major operations
**Consideration:** Balance between currency and efficiency

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
**What needs deciding:** Exact steps when updates conflict
**Context:** Rare but critical when it happens
**Current thought:** Manual review with Chris

### Validation Requirements
**What needs deciding:** What validations before trunk updates?
**Options:** Automated checks, manual approval, hybrid
**Consideration:** Speed vs safety

### Agent Assignment Method
**What needs deciding:** How agents know which branch to work on
**Context:** Need clear assignment mechanism
**Current thought:** Explicit in initial prompt


------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Document Matters

This operations manual ensures every agent follows the same procedures. Without consistent operations, the trunk-branch system becomes chaos. These workflows maintain order across parallel development.

Next document covers advanced systems and future considerations.
