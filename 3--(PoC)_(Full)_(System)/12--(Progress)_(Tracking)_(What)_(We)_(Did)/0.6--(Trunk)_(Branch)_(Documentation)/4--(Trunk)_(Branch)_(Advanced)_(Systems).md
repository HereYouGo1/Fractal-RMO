## What The Fuck Is This?

This document covers advanced features and future possibilities for the trunk-branch system that go BEYOND basic implementation. Think of it as "Part 2: The Stuff That Comes Later."

**What's actually in here:**
• **Edge cases and complex scenarios** - When shit gets weird (cascading dependencies, parallel conflicts)
• **The Synchronization Agent** - An automated system that COULD keep everything aligned (not built yet)
• **Future tooling ideas** - Dashboards, APIs, integrations that would be nice to have
• **Performance optimization** - How to make it fast when you have 100+ branches
• **System health monitoring** - Finding and fixing problems before they break everything
• **Cross-project patterns** - Using this system across multiple projects

**The reality check:**
Most of this is aspirational or handles situations you probably won't hit initially. Documents 1-3 contain everything you NEED to implement the trunk-branch system. This document is about what you COULD do once it's working.

**Should you read this now?**
• If you're just starting: NO - stick to Documents 1-3
• If the basic system is working: MAYBE - skim for relevant edge cases
• If you're scaling to many branches/agents: YES - you'll need these advanced patterns


------------------------------------------------------

## Context Sharing Deep Dive

### The Problem Context Sharing Solves

**Without context sharing:**
• Branch A-1 builds authentication
• Branch B-2 also needs authentication
• B-2 rebuilds the same thing
• Waste of effort, inconsistent implementations

**With context sharing:**
• A-1 builds authentication
• B-2 declares need for auth context
• B-2 references A-1's implementation
• Consistent, efficient, DRY

### Context Sharing Mechanism

#### Step 1: Context Requirement Analysis

**When creating new branch B-2:**
```markdown
## Context Requirement Analysis for B-2

### Primary Objective:
Build admin API endpoints

### Context Scan:
Reviewing all branches for relevant context...

A-1: Base agent class [RELEVANT - has request handling]
A-2: Error handling [RELEVANT - need error patterns]
A-3: Routing system [NOT RELEVANT]
B-1: User auth endpoints [RELEVANT - similar patterns]
C-1: Database models [RELEVANT - need user model]
C-2: Cache layer [NOT RELEVANT]
D: Complete logging [MAYBE - could use logs]

### Context Extraction Decision:
FROM A-1: Extract request handler base class only
FROM A-2: Reference error handling patterns
FROM B-1: Full endpoint structure as template
FROM C-1: User and Role models only
FROM D: Skip - will implement own logging
```

### Advanced Context Analysis Scenarios

#### Cascading Prerequisites

**The Problem:**
A needs B, B needs C, C doesn't exist yet.

```markdown
EXAMPLE: Building A-5 (deployment automation)

Gate 0 reveals:
- Need: Deployment scripts (B-4)
- B-4 needs: Server configs (C-3)
- C-3 doesn't exist!

Cascade resolution:
1. Document A-5 blocked on B-4
2. Document B-4 blocked on C-3
3. Propose C-3 to Chris:
   "A-5 needs B-4 which needs C-3 (server configs).
   Should I create C-3 first?"
4. Chris decides priority
5. Work backwards: C-3 → B-4 → A-5
```

#### Mid-Development Context Discovery

**The Problem:**
Halfway through building, you discover a new need.

```markdown
EXAMPLE: Working in A-3, suddenly need caching

Situation:
- 50% done with error recovery
- Realize: errors should be cached
- C-4 has caching logic

Protocol:
1. STOP current work
2. Document current state in handoff
3. Run Context Analysis for C-4
4. If RELEVANT: Import and continue
5. If UNCERTAIN: Ask Chris
6. Update A-3's O-F with new dependency
```

#### Context Relevance Changes

**The Problem:**
What was NOT RELEVANT becomes RELEVANT.

```markdown
EXAMPLE: A-3 initially didn't need logging

Original analysis:
- D (logging) → NOT RELEVANT
- Building basic error recovery

Scope change:
- Chris: "Add comprehensive error tracking"
- Now D is RELEVANT!

Re-evaluation:
1. Run Gates again with new scope
2. D now passes Gate 1 (needed)
3. Import D's logging patterns
4. Update dependency chain
5. Document scope change in work history
```

#### Parallel Branch Conflicts

**The Problem:**
Two branches building similar things unknowingly.

```markdown
EXAMPLE: A-4 and B-5 both building retry logic

Discovery:
- A-4 building retry for agents
- B-5 building retry for APIs
- Neither knows about the other

Resolution:
1. Sync agent detects duplication
2. Flags for Chris:
   "A-4 and B-5 both implementing retry.
   Should they share a common D-2 branch?"
3. Chris decides:
   - Create D-2 for shared retry
   - Both import from D-2
   - Or keep separate if different enough
```

#### Step 2: Context Documentation

**In B-2's O-F file:**
```markdown
## Shared Context Sources

### Full Context Imports:
- B-1: Complete endpoint structure [2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST]
  * Using as template for admin endpoints
  * Will modify for admin-specific needs

### Partial Context Imports:
- A-1: Request handler base [2025-09-01 | 09:30 EST]
  * Only using base class, not agent logic
- A-2: Error patterns [2025-09-01 | 09:00 EST]
  * Referencing patterns, not importing code
- C-1: User/Role models [2025-09-01 | 08:30 EST]
  * Direct import of model definitions

### Context Dependencies:
- If A-1 base class changes, update required
- If C-1 models change, critical update needed
- B-1 changes informational only
```

#### Step 3: Timestamp Tracking

**Git history shows updates:**
```bash
# Check B branch updates
git log --grep="B-" --oneline
# Shows:
# abc123 2025-09-01: B-2: Context imports documented
# def456 2025-09-01: B-1: Endpoint structure complete
# ghi789 2025-09-01: B-2: Admin endpoints created

# Check A branch updates  
git log --grep="A-" --oneline
# Shows:
# jkl012 2025-09-01: A-1: Base class finalized
# mno345 2025-09-01: A-1: Modified request handler ← AFTER B-2 imported!
```

#### Step 4: Update Detection

**On B-2's next login:**
```
1. Check context sources:
   - A-1 last imported: 09:30 EST
   - A-1 last updated: 16:00 EST
   - UPDATE NEEDED ⚠️

2. Read A-1's changes:
   - Request handler now async
   - New parameter added

3. Evaluate impact:
   - B-2 must update to async
   - New parameter is optional

4. Update B-2:
   - Modify to use async handler
   - Document change in work history
   - Update context timestamp
```

### Context Sharing Rules

**Can share:**
• Completed implementations
• Stable interfaces
• Data models
• Configuration patterns
• Error handling approaches

**Cannot share:**
• Work in progress
• Experimental features
• Branch-specific hacks
• Incomplete implementations

**Must document:**
• What was borrowed
• When it was borrowed (timestamp)
• How it's being used
• Update dependencies


------------------------------------------------------

## The Synchronization Agent

### Purpose and Responsibilities

**What the sync agent does:**
• Ensures trunk and branches stay aligned
• Updates context timestamps across branches
• Catches orphaned updates
• Validates documentation consistency
• Maintains the check-off system

**What it DOESN'T do:**
• Make decisions about conflicts
• Change implementation code
• Create new branches
• Merge branches

### Synchronization Agent Workflow

#### Phase 1: Trunk-Branch Alignment

```python
# Pseudo-code for sync agent logic

def sync_trunk_with_branches():
    trunk_of = read("(Trunk)_(O-F).md")
    
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        branch_of = read(f"({branch})_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F).md")
        
        # Check tech specs match
        if branch_of.tech_specs != trunk_of.tech_specs:
            if branch_of.tech_updated > trunk_of.tech_updated:
                # Branch has newer tech specs
                flag_for_review("Branch {branch} has newer tech specs")
            else:
                # Branch needs update
                update_branch_tech_specs(branch, trunk_of.tech_specs)
        
        # Check for new project-wide insights
        for insight in branch_of.insights:
            if is_project_wide(insight) and insight not in trunk_of.insights:
                promote_to_trunk(insight)
```

#### Phase 2: Context Update Propagation

```python
def propagate_context_updates():
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        for sub_branch in branch.sub_branches:
            context_sources = sub_branch.get_context_sources()
            
            for source in context_sources:
                source_branch, timestamp = parse_context_source(source)
                current_timestamp = get_latest_timestamp(source_branch)
                
                if current_timestamp > timestamp:
                    update_required(sub_branch, source_branch, current_timestamp)
```

#### Phase 3: Validation and Cleanup

```python
def validate_documentation():
    issues = []
    
    # Check all required files exist
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        if not exists(f"{branch}/0--(README_Folder)"):
            issues.append(f"Missing README in {branch}")
        if not exists(f"{branch}/0.1--(Index)_(Sub-Bnchs)"):
            issues.append(f"Missing index in {branch}")
    
    # Check work history indexes are current
    for sub_branch in get_all_sub_branches():
        if has_work_history(sub_branch):
            if not has_current_index(sub_branch):
                regenerate_index(sub_branch)
    
    return issues
```

### Check-off System (CRITICAL FOR EFFICIENCY)

**Chris's Requirement:** "I'll run him periodically and create a check off kind of system for him (so that he doesn't have to view every single project file every single time he runs)"

**HOW IT WORKS:**

**The Problem Without Check-off:**
```
Every sync agent run:
1. Check ALL trunk files
2. Check ALL branch files
3. Check ALL sub-branch files
4. Check ALL work history
= Checking 100+ files every time!
```

**The Solution With Check-off:**
```
Sync agent run:
1. Read check-off log
2. See what changed since last check
3. ONLY check changed items
4. Update check-off log
= Maybe checking 5-10 files!
```

**Check-off Log Format:**
```markdown
# Sync Agent Check-off Log
[Location: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/(Master)_(Timestamp)_(Log).md]

## Last Full System Scan: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST

## Trunk Status:
- Tech Specs: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [No changes]
- Long-term Memory: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [Updated A status]
- Project Description: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [No changes]
- Insights: ⚠️ 2025-09-01 | 16:00 EST [New Docker issue added]

## Branch Status:
### Branch A:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- A Main O-F: ✓ No changes
- A-1: ⚠️ Modified at 16:30 EST - NEEDS CHECK
- A-2: ✓ No changes since 14:00 EST
- Timestamp Log: Updated 16:30 EST

### Branch B:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 14:30 EST
- B Main O-F: ✓ No changes
- B-1: ✓ No changes
- B-2: 🆕 New sub-branch created - NEEDS FULL CHECK

### Branch C:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST
- Status: ⏭️ SKIPPED - No sub-branches exist

## Action Queue for Next Run:
1. Check A-1 changes (modified after last check)
2. Full check of new B-2
3. Verify trunk insights propagation
4. Skip C (no work yet)

## Efficiency Stats:
- Files in system: 127
- Files checked this run: 8
- Time saved: ~92%
```

**Check-off Decision Logic:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for what to check

for each item in system:
    last_check = check_off_log.get_last_check(item)
    last_modified = get_file_modified_time(item)
    
    if last_modified > last_check:
        CHECK_THIS_ITEM()
        update_check_off_log(item, now)
    else:
        SKIP_THIS_ITEM()
```

**WHY This Matters:**
Without the check-off system, the sync agent would spend 95% of its time rechecking unchanged files. Chris will run this periodically, and it needs to be fast.

**🔔 PENCILED: Check-off Implementation Details**
• **What needs deciding:** File-based vs database tracking
• **Why it matters:** Affects speed and complexity
• **Options:** Text file log, JSON file, SQLite database
• **Chris's note:** Start simple with file-based approach


------------------------------------------------------

## Managing Circular Dependencies

### UPDATED: Circular Dependencies ARE Allowed

**Chris's Clarification (2025-09-03):**
> "Why wouldn't two things be able to be dependent on each other? That's absolutely plausible."

Mutual dependencies CAN and DO exist in real systems.

### How to Handle Mutual Dependencies

**When A needs B AND B needs A:**

```markdown
EXAMPLE: Authentication and User Management

A-1 (auth) needs B-2 (users):
- Auth needs to verify users exist
- Auth needs user roles/permissions

B-2 (users) needs A-1 (auth):
- Users need auth for password hashing
- Users need auth for session creation

This is FINE! They're interdependent.
```

**Management Strategies:**

**1. Document Both Directions:**
```markdown
In A-1 O-F:
## Dependencies:
- Needs B-2: User verification
- B-2 needs us: Password hashing

In B-2 O-F:
## Dependencies:
- Needs A-1: Password hashing
- A-1 needs us: User verification
```

**2. Shared Abstraction Layer:**
```
Instead of direct circular:
A-1 ←→ B-2

Create shared interface:
A-1 → D-1 ← B-2
(D-1 = shared auth/user interface)
```

**3. Clear Import Boundaries:**
```markdown
A-1 imports from B-2:
- User model structure ONLY
- Not the full user logic

B-2 imports from A-1:
- Hash function ONLY
- Not the full auth system
```

### Update Propagation with Mutual Dependencies

**The Challenge:**
If A-1 updates, B-2 might need updating.
If B-2 updates from A-1, it changes, so A-1 might need updating again.

**The Solution: Version Pinning**
```markdown
## In A-1's O-F:
Imports from B-2: v1.2 [2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST]

## In B-2's O-F:
Imports from A-1: v1.1 [2025-09-01 | 09:00 EST]

When A-1 updates to v1.3:
- B-2 can choose when to import v1.3
- A-1 continues using B-2 v1.2
- No infinite cascade
```

### Complex Circular Patterns

**Transitive Circles (A → B → C → A):**
```
This is also ALLOWED if it makes sense!

Example:
A (agents) → B (API) → C (database) → A
- Agents call APIs
- APIs query database
- Database triggers affect agents

Document the full cycle in each O-F.
```

### When Circles ARE a Problem

**Infinite update loops:**
If every change triggers a cascade that never stops.

**Solution:** Lazy updates (already implemented)
- Updates only happen when branches become active
- Version pinning prevents cascades
- Chris controls major updates

**Unclear ownership:**
When you can't tell which branch owns what.

**Solution:** Clear extraction rules
- Each branch documents what it provides
- Each branch documents what it consumes
- No ambiguity about ownership


------------------------------------------------------

## Dependency Chain System with Lazy Updates

### FINALIZED DECISION: Lazy Update Propagation

**Chris's Directive:** "Only update dependencies when you actually need them - not automatically"

### How the Dependency Chain Works

**The Chain Structure:**
```
A-1 (base class) → B-2 (uses base) → C-3 (extends B-2) → D-1 (uses C-3)
         ↓                ↓                ↓                ↓
   [timestamp]      [timestamp]      [timestamp]      [timestamp]
```

**When A-1 Updates:**
```markdown
## Update Cascade Analysis

### Source Update:
- Branch: A-1
- Change: Base class now async
- Timestamp: 2025-09-01 | 16:00 EST

### Direct Dependencies:
- B-2: Last imported A-1 at 09:30 EST [STALE]
- E-1: Last imported A-1 at 14:00 EST [STALE]

### Transitive Dependencies:
- C-3: Depends on B-2 (which is now stale)
- D-1: Depends on C-3 (chain reaction)

### Lazy Update Strategy:
- Mark B-2 and E-1 as "stale"
- Do NOT auto-update
- Update only when branch becomes active
```

### Implementing Lazy Updates

**In Each Branch's O-F:**
```markdown
## Dependency Status

### Direct Dependencies:
- A-1 base class: ⚠️ STALE (updated 16:00, we have 09:30)
- C-1 models: ✓ CURRENT (no changes since import)

### Update Strategy:
- Will update A-1 when next working in this branch
- C-1 monitoring for changes
- No automatic updates
```

**When Entering a Stale Branch:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for agent entering B-2

def enter_branch(branch_name):
    stale_deps = check_dependencies(branch_name)
    
    if stale_deps:
        print(f"⚠️ Found {len(stale_deps)} stale dependencies")
        
        for dep in stale_deps:
            print(f"- {dep.name}: Last updated {dep.timestamp}")
            print(f"  Current version: {dep.current_timestamp}")
            
        decision = prompt("Update now? (y/n/selective)")
        
        if decision == 'y':
            update_all_dependencies()
        elif decision == 'selective':
            choose_updates(stale_deps)
        else:
            print("Proceeding with stale dependencies")
            document_risk("Working with outdated dependencies")
```

### Dependency Chain Documentation

**Master Dependency Map (in Trunk):**
```markdown
# System Dependency Map
[Location: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/1--(Trunk)_(O-F)/(Dependency)_(Map).md]

## Dependency Chains:

### Authentication Chain:
A-1 (base auth) → B-1 (user auth) → B-2 (admin auth)
                → C-2 (API auth) → D-1 (service auth)

### Model Chain:
C-1 (base models) → A-2 (agent models)
                  → B-3 (API models) → E-1 (cache models)

### Error Handling Chain:
A-2 (base errors) → B-1 (API errors)
                  → C-3 (DB errors) → D-2 (service errors)

## Stale Branches (as of 2025-09-01 | 17:00 EST):
- B-2: Stale A-1 dependency
- C-3: Stale via B-2
- D-1: Stale via C-3 chain
- E-1: Direct stale from A-1
```

### Benefits of Lazy Updates

**Why Chris Chose This:**
1. **Efficiency**: Don't waste time updating inactive branches
2. **Stability**: Branches in progress aren't disrupted
3. **Control**: Agent decides when to absorb changes
4. **Clarity**: Can see exactly what changed before updating

**Example Scenario:**
```
A-1 changes Monday
B-2 is inactive Monday-Thursday
Friday: Agent enters B-2
- Sees A-1 changed
- Reviews changes
- Updates only if needed for Friday's work
- Maybe the change doesn't even affect what B-2 needs!
```

------------------------------------------------------

## Sub-Branch Proposition Sheet System

### FINALIZED DECISION: Agents Propose Sub-Branches Before Creation

**Chris's Requirement:** "Before creating a sub-branch, document what it will do"

### The Proposition Sheet

**Location:** Before creating A-3, create:
```
0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/
  2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/
    0.3--(Sub-Branch)_(Propositions)/
      (A-3)_(Proposition).md
```

**Proposition Template:**
```markdown
# Sub-Branch Proposition: A-3

## Proposed By: [Agent Name]
## Date: 2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST
## Status: PROPOSED

## Purpose:
Build error recovery system for agent failures

## Deliverable:
- Complete error recovery module
- Retry logic implementation
- Fallback strategies
- Testing suite

## Context Requirements:
### Will Import From:
- A-1: Base agent class
- A-2: Error handling patterns

### Will NOT Need:
- B branches (API not relevant)
- C branches (cache not relevant)

## Success Criteria:
- Agents can recover from transient failures
- Clear error messages for permanent failures
- No infinite retry loops
- All errors logged properly

## Estimated Scope:
- 3-4 agent sessions
- ~2000 lines of code
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Dependency Impact:
- Other branches may want to import this
- No breaking changes to A-1 or A-2
- Will create new error types

## Notes:
- Considering circuit breaker pattern
- May need Chris input on retry limits
```

### Proposition Review Process

**Chris Reviews Propositions:**
```markdown
## Review Decision: A-3

### Status: APPROVED ✓
### Date: 2025-09-01 | 11:00 EST
### Reviewed By: Chris

### Comments:
- Good scope definition
- Add exponential backoff to retry logic
- Max 3 retries for API calls
- Log all retry attempts

### Proceed: YES
### Priority: HIGH
```

**Or Rejection:**
```markdown
## Review Decision: B-5

### Status: REJECTED ✗
### Date: 2025-09-01 | 11:00 EST
### Reviewed By: Chris

### Reason:
- Scope too large for sub-branch
- Should be split into B-5 and B-6
- B-5: Just the caching logic
- B-6: The persistence layer

### Alternative:
Create two separate propositions with smaller scope
```

### Benefits of Proposition System

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Prevents Sprawl**: Can't create random sub-branches
2. **Clear Scope**: Everyone knows what A-3 will deliver
3. **Better Planning**: Can see overlaps before they happen
4. **Dependency Awareness**: Know impacts upfront
5. **Chris Oversight**: He can guide without micromanaging

### Quick Proposition Check

**Before Starting Work:**
```python
# Agent pseudo-code
def can_start_work(branch_name):
    prop_file = f"(Sub-Branch)_(Propositions)/({branch_name})_(Proposition).md"
    
    if not exists(prop_file):
        return False, "No proposition found"
    
    status = read_proposition_status(prop_file)
    
    if status == "APPROVED":
        return True, "Ready to begin"
    elif status == "PROPOSED":
        return False, "Awaiting Chris review"
    elif status == "REJECTED":
        return False, "See rejection reason"
```

### Proposition Tracking System

**How the System Would Track Propositions:**

Each main branch would maintain a propositions document that tracks what's been proposed. This gives Chris visibility into what agents think is needed.

**Tracking Format Design:**
```markdown
# Sub-Branch Propositions Tracking
[This would be in each main branch's propositions document]

## Status Categories:
- PROPOSED: Waiting for Chris to review
- APPROVED: Chris said yes, can be created
- REJECTED: Won't be created (with reason)
- CREATED: Actually built and active

## Example of how tracking would look:
[Branch-ID]: [Description] - [Status] - [Date]
```

**WHY This Tracking Matters:**
- Prevents duplicate proposals
- Shows what's already been considered
- Maintains history of decisions
- Helps agents understand what's approved vs pending

------------------------------------------------------

## Branch Merging Advanced Scenarios

### Partial Branch Merging

**Scenario:** A-1 and B-3 share authentication logic

**Options:**

#### Option 1: Extract to New Branch
```
Create D branch for "Shared Authentication"
Move auth from A-1 and B-3 to D-1
A-1 and B-3 now reference D-1
```

#### Option 2: Designate Primary
```
A-1 becomes primary auth source
B-3 references A-1 for auth
Document in both O-F files
```

#### Option 3: Create Library Branch
```
Create L branch for "Libraries"
L-1 contains shared auth module
All branches reference L-1
```

### Branch Persistence After Merge (CRITICAL)

**Chris's Specific Rule:** "When branches merge entirely (for example C, and F merge into C-F), the C, and F branches don't go anywhere, and shouldn't"

**WHY Originals Stay:**
```
Scenario: C (cache) and F (frontend) merge to C-F

Later: C branch needs cache-specific optimization
- Work in C with ONLY cache context
- No frontend code cluttering view
- Test optimization in isolation
- If successful, update flows to C-F
```

**Update Flow After Merge:**
```
C updated → Sync agent checks → Does it affect C-F? → Update C-F
F updated → Sync agent checks → Does it affect C-F? → Update C-F
C-F updated → Standalone development → Doesn't flow back to C or F
```

**In Practice:**
```markdown
# In C-F's O-F:

## Branch Origin:
- Merged from: C (cache system) + F (frontend)
- Merge date: 2025-09-01
- Original branches: Still active for independent work

## Update Monitoring:
- C last checked: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- F last checked: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- Auto-sync from: C (critical changes), F (UI updates)
```

### Complex Merge Scenarios

**Scenario:** A, B, C all partially complete, need integration

**Approach:**
```
1. Create integration branch I
2. I-1 focuses on A-B integration
3. I-2 focuses on B-C integration
4. I-3 focuses on A-C integration
5. I-4 combines all integrations
6. Original A, B, C remain for reference
```

**Documentation in I's O-F:**
```markdown
## Integration Branch Origin

### Purpose:
Integrate Agent (A), API (B), and Cache (C) systems

### Source Branches:
- A: Agent system (70% complete)
- B: API endpoints (80% complete)
- C: Cache layer (60% complete)

### Integration Strategy:
- I-1: Agent-API connection
- I-2: API-Cache connection
- I-3: Agent-Cache connection
- I-4: Full system integration

### Dependencies:
- Cannot modify A, B, C originals
- Must maintain compatibility
- Document all integration points
```

## Work History Indexing System

### Three-Level Index System

#### Level 1: Trunk Index
```markdown
# Master Work Index

## Main Branches:
- A: Agent System (15 work items)
- B: API Development (12 work items)
- C: Cache System (8 work items)

#### Level 2: Branch Index
```markdown
# Branch A Work Index

## Sub-Branches:
- A-1: Base agents (5 work items)
- A-2: Error handling (4 work items)
- A-3: Routing (6 work items)

## Key Milestones:
- 2025-09-01: Base class complete
- 2025-09-03: Error handling added
- 2025-09-05: Routing implemented
```

#### Level 3: Sub-Branch Index
```markdown
# A-1 Work History Index

## Work Items:
1. **Setup Initial** - Environment and dependencies
2. **Base Class Design** - Created agent interface
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Added LLM connection
4. **Error Handling** - Basic error management
5. **Testing Suite** - Unit tests for agents

## Quick Links:
- Initial design: Item 2, line 45
- API keys issue: Item 3, line 120
- Error patterns: Item 4, line 200
```

## Sub-Branch O-F Evolution - Task-Based Architecture

### The Transformation
**From:** Vague status tracking with 3-item memory
**To:** Complete task management system with full context

### Benefits of Task-Based O-F
1. **Serves as project plan** - See all work planned/completed
2. **Provides long-term memory** - Complete history in task structure
3. **Shows exact position** - "Currently at Task 2.3"
4. **Simplifies handoffs** - Just point to current task
5. **Attaches insights to work** - Gotchas linked to relevant tasks

### Impact on System
- Handoff files become minimal (just current blockers)
- Work History Index still valuable for deep dives
- O-F becomes single source of truth for sub-branch state
- Agents get complete context without reading 10 files
