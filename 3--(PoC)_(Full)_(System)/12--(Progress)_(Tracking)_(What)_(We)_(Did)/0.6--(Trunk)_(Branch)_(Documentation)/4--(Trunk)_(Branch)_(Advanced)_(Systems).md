## What The Fuck Is This?

This document covers the advanced features of the trunk-branch system - how branches share context, the synchronization agent that keeps everything aligned, and all the PENCILED items that need decisions.

• **Context sharing mechanism** - How branches borrow from each other
• **Synchronization agent** - The automated cleanup crew
• **Future considerations** - What needs to be decided and built


------------------------------------------------------

## Context Sharing Deep Dive

### The Problem Context Sharing Solves

**Without context sharing:**
• Branch A-1 builds authentication
• Branch B-2 also needs authentication
• B-2 rebuilds the same thing
• Waste of effort, inconsistent implementations

**With context sharing:**
• A-1 builds authentication
• B-2 declares need for auth context
• B-2 references A-1's implementation
• Consistent, efficient, DRY

### Context Sharing Mechanism

#### Step 1: Context Requirement Analysis

**When creating new branch B-2:**
```markdown
## Context Requirement Analysis for B-2

### Primary Objective:
Build admin API endpoints

### Context Scan:
Reviewing all branches for relevant context...

A-1: Base agent class [RELEVANT - has request handling]
A-2: Error handling [RELEVANT - need error patterns]
A-3: Routing system [NOT RELEVANT]
B-1: User auth endpoints [RELEVANT - similar patterns]
C-1: Database models [RELEVANT - need user model]
C-2: Cache layer [NOT RELEVANT]
D: Complete logging [MAYBE - could use logs]

### Context Extraction Decision:
FROM A-1: Extract request handler base class only
FROM A-2: Reference error handling patterns
FROM B-1: Full endpoint structure as template
FROM C-1: User and Role models only
FROM D: Skip - will implement own logging
```

**🔔 PENCILED: Specific analysis structure TBD**

#### Step 2: Context Documentation

**In B-2's O-F file:**
```markdown
## Shared Context Sources

### Full Context Imports:
- B-1: Complete endpoint structure [2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST]
  * Using as template for admin endpoints
  * Will modify for admin-specific needs

### Partial Context Imports:
- A-1: Request handler base [2025-09-01 | 09:30 EST]
  * Only using base class, not agent logic
- A-2: Error patterns [2025-09-01 | 09:00 EST]
  * Referencing patterns, not importing code
- C-1: User/Role models [2025-09-01 | 08:30 EST]
  * Direct import of model definitions

### Context Dependencies:
- If A-1 base class changes, update required
- If C-1 models change, critical update needed
- B-1 changes informational only
```

#### Step 3: Timestamp Tracking

**B's timestamp log shows:**
```markdown
# Timestamp Update Log - Branch B

## Sub-Branch Updates:
- B-2: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST | Context imports documented
- B-1: 2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST | Endpoint structure complete
- B-2: 2025-09-01 | 15:30 EST | Admin endpoints created
```

**A's timestamp log shows:**
```markdown
# Timestamp Update Log - Branch A

## Sub-Branch Updates:
- A-1: 2025-09-01 | 09:30 EST | Base class finalized
- A-1: 2025-09-01 | 16:00 EST | Modified request handler ← AFTER B-2 imported!
```

#### Step 4: Update Detection

**On B-2's next login:**
```
1. Check context sources:
   - A-1 last imported: 09:30 EST
   - A-1 last updated: 16:00 EST
   - UPDATE NEEDED ⚠️

2. Read A-1's changes:
   - Request handler now async
   - New parameter added

3. Evaluate impact:
   - B-2 must update to async
   - New parameter is optional

4. Update B-2:
   - Modify to use async handler
   - Document change in work history
   - Update context timestamp
```

### Context Sharing Rules

**Can share:**
• Completed implementations
• Stable interfaces
• Data models
• Configuration patterns
• Error handling approaches

**Cannot share:**
• Work in progress
• Experimental features
• Branch-specific hacks
• Incomplete implementations

**Must document:**
• What was borrowed
• When it was borrowed (timestamp)
• How it's being used
• Update dependencies


------------------------------------------------------

## The Synchronization Agent

### Purpose and Responsibilities

**What the sync agent does:**
• Ensures trunk and branches stay aligned
• Updates context timestamps across branches
• Catches orphaned updates
• Validates documentation consistency
• Maintains the check-off system

**What it DOESN'T do:**
• Make decisions about conflicts
• Change implementation code
• Create new branches
• Merge branches

### Synchronization Agent Workflow

#### Phase 1: Trunk-Branch Alignment

```python
# Pseudo-code for sync agent logic

def sync_trunk_with_branches():
    trunk_of = read("(Trunk)_(O-F).md")
    
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        branch_of = read(f"({branch})_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F).md")
        
        # Check tech specs match
        if branch_of.tech_specs != trunk_of.tech_specs:
            if branch_of.tech_updated > trunk_of.tech_updated:
                # Branch has newer tech specs
                flag_for_review("Branch {branch} has newer tech specs")
            else:
                # Branch needs update
                update_branch_tech_specs(branch, trunk_of.tech_specs)
        
        # Check for new project-wide insights
        for insight in branch_of.insights:
            if is_project_wide(insight) and insight not in trunk_of.insights:
                promote_to_trunk(insight)
```

#### Phase 2: Context Update Propagation

```python
def propagate_context_updates():
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        for sub_branch in branch.sub_branches:
            context_sources = sub_branch.get_context_sources()
            
            for source in context_sources:
                source_branch, timestamp = parse_context_source(source)
                current_timestamp = get_latest_timestamp(source_branch)
                
                if current_timestamp > timestamp:
                    update_required(sub_branch, source_branch, current_timestamp)
```

#### Phase 3: Validation and Cleanup

```python
def validate_documentation():
    issues = []
    
    # Check all required files exist
    for branch in get_all_branches():
        if not exists(f"{branch}/0--(README_Folder)"):
            issues.append(f"Missing README in {branch}")
        if not exists(f"{branch}/0.1--(Index)_(Sub-Bnchs)"):
            issues.append(f"Missing index in {branch}")
    
    # Check work history indexes are current
    for sub_branch in get_all_sub_branches():
        if has_work_history(sub_branch):
            if not has_current_index(sub_branch):
                regenerate_index(sub_branch)
    
    return issues
```

### Check-off System (CRITICAL FOR EFFICIENCY)

**Chris's Requirement:** "I'll run him periodically and create a check off kind of system for him (so that he doesn't have to view every single project file every single time he runs)"

**HOW IT WORKS:**

**The Problem Without Check-off:**
```
Every sync agent run:
1. Check ALL trunk files
2. Check ALL branch files
3. Check ALL sub-branch files
4. Check ALL work history
= Checking 100+ files every time!
```

**The Solution With Check-off:**
```
Sync agent run:
1. Read check-off log
2. See what changed since last check
3. ONLY check changed items
4. Update check-off log
= Maybe checking 5-10 files!
```

**Check-off Log Format:**
```markdown
# Sync Agent Check-off Log
[Location: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/(Master)_(Timestamp)_(Log).md]

## Last Full System Scan: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST

## Trunk Status:
- Tech Specs: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [No changes]
- Long-term Memory: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [Updated A status]
- Project Description: ✓ 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST [No changes]
- Insights: ⚠️ 2025-09-01 | 16:00 EST [New Docker issue added]

## Branch Status:
### Branch A:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- A Main O-F: ✓ No changes
- A-1: ⚠️ Modified at 16:30 EST - NEEDS CHECK
- A-2: ✓ No changes since 14:00 EST
- Timestamp Log: Updated 16:30 EST

### Branch B:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 14:30 EST
- B Main O-F: ✓ No changes
- B-1: ✓ No changes
- B-2: 🆕 New sub-branch created - NEEDS FULL CHECK

### Branch C:
- Last Check: 2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST
- Status: ⏭️ SKIPPED - No sub-branches exist

## Action Queue for Next Run:
1. Check A-1 changes (modified after last check)
2. Full check of new B-2
3. Verify trunk insights propagation
4. Skip C (no work yet)

## Efficiency Stats:
- Files in system: 127
- Files checked this run: 8
- Time saved: ~92%
```

**Check-off Decision Logic:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for what to check

for each item in system:
    last_check = check_off_log.get_last_check(item)
    last_modified = get_file_modified_time(item)
    
    if last_modified > last_check:
        CHECK_THIS_ITEM()
        update_check_off_log(item, now)
    else:
        SKIP_THIS_ITEM()
```

**WHY This Matters:**
Without the check-off system, the sync agent would spend 95% of its time rechecking unchanged files. Chris will run this periodically, and it needs to be fast.

**🔔 PENCILED: Check-off Implementation Details**
• **What needs deciding:** File-based vs database tracking
• **Why it matters:** Affects speed and complexity
• **Options:** Text file log, JSON file, SQLite database
• **Chris's note:** Start simple with file-based approach


------------------------------------------------------

## Circular Dependency Prevention

### The Circular Dependency Problem

**What Chris is worried about:**
```
A-1 needs context from B-2
B-2 needs context from A-1
= Infinite update loop!
```

**Detection Rules:**

**BEFORE creating any context dependency:**
```markdown
## Circular Dependency Check

### Step 1: List what I need
A-1 needs: B-2 authentication

### Step 2: Check what B-2 needs
B-2's O-F shows:
- Needs: C-1 database
- Needs: A-1 base class  ← CIRCULAR DETECTED!

### Step 3: Resolution
Options:
1. Extract shared part to new branch
2. Remove one direction of dependency
3. Refactor to eliminate coupling
```

**Prevention Strategies:**

**1. Dependency Graph (Visual Check):**
```
A-1 → B-2 → C-1
 ↑___________↓    [CIRCULAR!]
```

**2. Forbidden Patterns:**
```
FORBIDDEN:
- Mutual dependencies (A needs B, B needs A)
- Transitive cycles (A → B → C → A)
- Self-dependencies (A-1 needs A-1)

ALLOWED:
- One-way dependencies (A → B)
- Shared dependencies (A → C, B → C)
- Hierarchical (A → A-1 → A-1-a)
```

**3. Dependency Declaration Rules:**
```markdown
## In Branch O-F:

### Context Dependencies:
- Critical: Must have, breaks without
- Important: Should have, degraded without
- Informational: Nice to have, works without

### Dependency Direction:
- THIS branch depends on: [list]
- Branches that depend on THIS: [track these!]
```

**If Circular Dependency Found:**
1. Document in LLM Limitations
2. Create mediation branch for shared logic
3. Refactor to break cycle
4. Add to validation rules


------------------------------------------------------

## Dependency Chain System with Lazy Updates

### FINALIZED DECISION: Lazy Update Propagation

**Chris's Directive:** "Only update dependencies when you actually need them - not automatically"

### How the Dependency Chain Works

**The Chain Structure:**
```
A-1 (base class) → B-2 (uses base) → C-3 (extends B-2) → D-1 (uses C-3)
         ↓                ↓                ↓                ↓
   [timestamp]      [timestamp]      [timestamp]      [timestamp]
```

**When A-1 Updates:**
```markdown
## Update Cascade Analysis

### Source Update:
- Branch: A-1
- Change: Base class now async
- Timestamp: 2025-09-01 | 16:00 EST

### Direct Dependencies:
- B-2: Last imported A-1 at 09:30 EST [STALE]
- E-1: Last imported A-1 at 14:00 EST [STALE]

### Transitive Dependencies:
- C-3: Depends on B-2 (which is now stale)
- D-1: Depends on C-3 (chain reaction)

### Lazy Update Strategy:
- Mark B-2 and E-1 as "stale"
- Do NOT auto-update
- Update only when branch becomes active
```

### Implementing Lazy Updates

**In Each Branch's O-F:**
```markdown
## Dependency Status

### Direct Dependencies:
- A-1 base class: ⚠️ STALE (updated 16:00, we have 09:30)
- C-1 models: ✓ CURRENT (no changes since import)

### Update Strategy:
- Will update A-1 when next working in this branch
- C-1 monitoring for changes
- No automatic updates
```

**When Entering a Stale Branch:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for agent entering B-2

def enter_branch(branch_name):
    stale_deps = check_dependencies(branch_name)
    
    if stale_deps:
        print(f"⚠️ Found {len(stale_deps)} stale dependencies")
        
        for dep in stale_deps:
            print(f"- {dep.name}: Last updated {dep.timestamp}")
            print(f"  Current version: {dep.current_timestamp}")
            
        decision = prompt("Update now? (y/n/selective)")
        
        if decision == 'y':
            update_all_dependencies()
        elif decision == 'selective':
            choose_updates(stale_deps)
        else:
            print("Proceeding with stale dependencies")
            document_risk("Working with outdated dependencies")
```

### Dependency Chain Documentation

**Master Dependency Map (in Trunk):**
```markdown
# System Dependency Map
[Location: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/1--(Trunk)_(O-F)/(Dependency)_(Map).md]

## Dependency Chains:

### Authentication Chain:
A-1 (base auth) → B-1 (user auth) → B-2 (admin auth)
                → C-2 (API auth) → D-1 (service auth)

### Model Chain:
C-1 (base models) → A-2 (agent models)
                  → B-3 (API models) → E-1 (cache models)

### Error Handling Chain:
A-2 (base errors) → B-1 (API errors)
                  → C-3 (DB errors) → D-2 (service errors)

## Stale Branches (as of 2025-09-01 | 17:00 EST):
- B-2: Stale A-1 dependency
- C-3: Stale via B-2
- D-1: Stale via C-3 chain
- E-1: Direct stale from A-1
```

### Benefits of Lazy Updates

**Why Chris Chose This:**
1. **Efficiency**: Don't waste time updating inactive branches
2. **Stability**: Branches in progress aren't disrupted
3. **Control**: Agent decides when to absorb changes
4. **Clarity**: Can see exactly what changed before updating

**Example Scenario:**
```
A-1 changes Monday
B-2 is inactive Monday-Thursday
Friday: Agent enters B-2
- Sees A-1 changed
- Reviews changes
- Updates only if needed for Friday's work
- Maybe the change doesn't even affect what B-2 needs!
```

------------------------------------------------------

## Sub-Branch Proposition Sheet System

### FINALIZED DECISION: Agents Propose Sub-Branches Before Creation

**Chris's Requirement:** "Before creating a sub-branch, document what it will do"

### The Proposition Sheet

**Location:** Before creating A-3, create:
```
0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/
  2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/
    0.3--(Sub-Branch)_(Propositions)/
      (A-3)_(Proposition).md
```

**Proposition Template:**
```markdown
# Sub-Branch Proposition: A-3

## Proposed By: [Agent Name]
## Date: 2025-09-01 | 10:00 EST
## Status: PROPOSED

## Purpose:
Build error recovery system for agent failures

## Deliverable:
- Complete error recovery module
- Retry logic implementation
- Fallback strategies
- Testing suite

## Context Requirements:
### Will Import From:
- A-1: Base agent class
- A-2: Error handling patterns

### Will NOT Need:
- B branches (API not relevant)
- C branches (cache not relevant)

## Success Criteria:
- Agents can recover from transient failures
- Clear error messages for permanent failures
- No infinite retry loops
- All errors logged properly

## Estimated Scope:
- 3-4 agent sessions
- ~2000 lines of code
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Dependency Impact:
- Other branches may want to import this
- No breaking changes to A-1 or A-2
- Will create new error types

## Notes:
- Considering circuit breaker pattern
- May need Chris input on retry limits
```

### Proposition Review Process

**Chris Reviews Propositions:**
```markdown
## Review Decision: A-3

### Status: APPROVED ✓
### Date: 2025-09-01 | 11:00 EST
### Reviewed By: Chris

### Comments:
- Good scope definition
- Add exponential backoff to retry logic
- Max 3 retries for API calls
- Log all retry attempts

### Proceed: YES
### Priority: HIGH
```

**Or Rejection:**
```markdown
## Review Decision: B-5

### Status: REJECTED ✗
### Date: 2025-09-01 | 11:00 EST
### Reviewed By: Chris

### Reason:
- Scope too large for sub-branch
- Should be split into B-5 and B-6
- B-5: Just the caching logic
- B-6: The persistence layer

### Alternative:
Create two separate propositions with smaller scope
```

### Benefits of Proposition System

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Prevents Sprawl**: Can't create random sub-branches
2. **Clear Scope**: Everyone knows what A-3 will deliver
3. **Better Planning**: Can see overlaps before they happen
4. **Dependency Awareness**: Know impacts upfront
5. **Chris Oversight**: He can guide without micromanaging

### Quick Proposition Check

**Before Starting Work:**
```python
# Agent pseudo-code
def can_start_work(branch_name):
    prop_file = f"(Sub-Branch)_(Propositions)/({branch_name})_(Proposition).md"
    
    if not exists(prop_file):
        return False, "No proposition found"
    
    status = read_proposition_status(prop_file)
    
    if status == "APPROVED":
        return True, "Ready to begin"
    elif status == "PROPOSED":
        return False, "Awaiting Chris review"
    elif status == "REJECTED":
        return False, "See rejection reason"
```

### Proposition Tracking System

**How the System Would Track Propositions:**

Each main branch would maintain a propositions document that tracks what's been proposed. This gives Chris visibility into what agents think is needed.

**Tracking Format Design:**
```markdown
# Sub-Branch Propositions Tracking
[This would be in each main branch's propositions document]

## Status Categories:
- PROPOSED: Waiting for Chris to review
- APPROVED: Chris said yes, can be created
- REJECTED: Won't be created (with reason)
- CREATED: Actually built and active

## Example of how tracking would look:
[Branch-ID]: [Description] - [Status] - [Date]
```

**WHY This Tracking Matters:**
- Prevents duplicate proposals
- Shows what's already been considered
- Maintains history of decisions
- Helps agents understand what's approved vs pending

------------------------------------------------------

## Branch Merging Advanced Scenarios

### Partial Branch Merging

**Scenario:** A-1 and B-3 share authentication logic

**Options:**

#### Option 1: Extract to New Branch
```
Create D branch for "Shared Authentication"
Move auth from A-1 and B-3 to D-1
A-1 and B-3 now reference D-1
```

#### Option 2: Designate Primary
```
A-1 becomes primary auth source
B-3 references A-1 for auth
Document in both O-F files
```

#### Option 3: Create Library Branch
```
Create L branch for "Libraries"
L-1 contains shared auth module
All branches reference L-1
```

### Branch Persistence After Merge (CRITICAL)

**Chris's Specific Rule:** "When branches merge entirely (for example C, and F merge into C-F), the C, and F branches don't go anywhere, and shouldn't"

**WHY Originals Stay:**
```
Scenario: C (cache) and F (frontend) merge to C-F

Later: C branch needs cache-specific optimization
- Work in C with ONLY cache context
- No frontend code cluttering view
- Test optimization in isolation
- If successful, update flows to C-F
```

**Update Flow After Merge:**
```
C updated → Sync agent checks → Does it affect C-F? → Update C-F
F updated → Sync agent checks → Does it affect C-F? → Update C-F
C-F updated → Standalone development → Doesn't flow back to C or F
```

**In Practice:**
```markdown
# In C-F's O-F:

## Branch Origin:
- Merged from: C (cache system) + F (frontend)
- Merge date: 2025-09-01
- Original branches: Still active for independent work

## Update Monitoring:
- C last checked: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- F last checked: 2025-09-01 | 15:00 EST
- Auto-sync from: C (critical changes), F (UI updates)
```

### Complex Merge Scenarios

**Scenario:** A, B, C all partially complete, need integration

**Approach:**
```
1. Create integration branch I
2. I-1 focuses on A-B integration
3. I-2 focuses on B-C integration
4. I-3 focuses on A-C integration
5. I-4 combines all integrations
6. Original A, B, C remain for reference
```

**Documentation in I's O-F:**
```markdown
## Integration Branch Origin

### Purpose:
Integrate Agent (A), API (B), and Cache (C) systems

### Source Branches:
- A: Agent system (70% complete)
- B: API endpoints (80% complete)
- C: Cache layer (60% complete)

### Integration Strategy:
- I-1: Agent-API connection
- I-2: API-Cache connection
- I-3: Agent-Cache connection
- I-4: Full system integration

### Dependencies:
- Cannot modify A, B, C originals
- Must maintain compatibility
- Document all integration points
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Work History Indexing System

### Purpose of Indexes

**Why we need indexes:**
• Quick navigation to specific work
• Understanding progression without reading everything
• Finding when specific decisions were made
• Tracking feature implementation timeline

### Three-Level Index System

#### Level 1: Trunk Index
```markdown
# Master Work Index

## Main Branches:
- A: Agent System (15 work items)
- B: API Development (12 work items)
- C: Cache System (8 work items)

## Timeline:
- Week 1: Project setup, Docker config
- Week 2: Agent base classes
- Week 3: API structure
- Week 4: Integration begins
```

#### Level 2: Branch Index
```markdown
# Branch A Work Index

## Sub-Branches:
- A-1: Base agents (5 work items)
- A-2: Error handling (4 work items)
- A-3: Routing (6 work items)

## Key Milestones:
- 2025-09-01: Base class complete
- 2025-09-03: Error handling added
- 2025-09-05: Routing implemented
```

#### Level 3: Sub-Branch Index
```markdown
# A-1 Work History Index

## Work Items:
1. **Setup Initial** - Environment and dependencies
2. **Base Class Design** - Created agent interface
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Added LLM connection
4. **Error Handling** - Basic error management
5. **Testing Suite** - Unit tests for agents

## Quick Links:
- Initial design: Item 2, line 45
- API keys issue: Item 3, line 120
- Error patterns: Item 4, line 200
```


------------------------------------------------------

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### System Failure Scenarios

#### Failure 1: Sync Agent Corrupts Data

**Symptoms:**
• Branches show inconsistent states
• Tech specs don't match across system
• Updates disappear
• Handoff files out of sync with O-F files

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Restore from git
git log --oneline -n 20
git checkout [last-good-commit] -- "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/"

# Manual reconciliation
1. Compare trunk with all branches
2. Identify correct state
3. Manually update each O-F
4. Restore handoff files from last good state
5. Document in LLM Limitations at:
   0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/0.3--(LLM)_(Limitations)_(Discovered)/
```

#### Failure 2: Circular Context Dependencies

**Symptoms:**
• A-1 needs B-2 context
• B-2 needs A-1 context
• Infinite update loop

**Prevention:**
```markdown
## Context Dependency Rules

FORBIDDEN:
- Circular dependencies
- Transitive dependencies >2 levels
- Importing from work-in-progress

REQUIRED:
- Document dependency direction
- Check for cycles before import
- Maintain dependency graph
```

#### Failure 3: Branch Divergence

**Symptoms:**
• Branch develops incompatible changes
• Can't merge back to trunk
• Integration becomes impossible

**Recovery:**
```
1. Freeze divergent branch
2. Create compatibility branch
3. Build adapter layer
4. Document incompatibility
5. Plan migration strategy
```

## System Evolution Considerations

### Scaling Challenges

**At 10 branches:**
• Manageable with manual sync
• Context sharing straightforward
• Simple dependency tracking

**At 50 branches:**
• Need automated sync agent
• Context graph becomes complex
• Require dependency visualization

**At 100+ branches:**
• Need branch clustering
• Automated conflict resolution
• Machine-readable dependency specs
• Possible database for tracking

### Migration Strategies

**From current to trunk-branch:**
```
Phase 1: Setup
- Create trunk O-F from current
- Move work files to sub-branches
- Update contribution guidelines

Phase 2: Test
- Run single branch for a week
- Verify procedures work
- Document issues

Phase 3: Scale
- Add second branch
- Test context sharing
- Implement sync agent

Phase 4: Full migration
- Move all work to branches
- Archive old structure
- Full system operational
```

## 🔔 MASTER LIST OF PENCILED ITEMS

### Critical Decisions Needed

#### Branch Scope and Deliverables
**DECISION FINALIZED:** Branches are scoped by deliverables, not token counts
**Why this matters:** Ensures work completes naturally without artificial breaks
**Implementation:** 
- Each sub-branch represents one complete deliverable
- No token counting or limits enforced
- Natural work boundaries guide branch creation
**Chris's directive:** "Focus on deliverables, forget token tracking"

#### Context Analysis Guidelines
**What needs deciding:** Specific rules for what context to import
**Why it matters:** Prevents over/under importing
**Considerations:**
- Relevance threshold
- Stability requirements
- Version compatibility
**Recommendation:** Create relevance scoring system

#### Synchronization Agent Frequency
**What needs deciding:** How often sync agent runs
**Why it matters:** Balance freshness vs overhead
**Options:**
- Continuous (every change)
- Periodic (hourly/daily)
- Triggered (on events)
**Recommendation:** Hourly with manual trigger option

#### Git Integration Strategy
**What needs deciding:** How git branches relate to doc branches
**Why it matters:** Need version control alignment
**Options:**
- Mirror structure (git branch per doc branch)
- Single git branch (all docs together)
- Hybrid (main branches only in git)
**Recommendation:** Research git workflows first

#### Check-off System Implementation
**What needs deciding:** Exact mechanism for sync agent memory
**Why it matters:** Efficiency of synchronization
**Options:**
- File-based timestamps
- Database tracking
- Smart diffing
**Recommendation:** Start with file-based, evolve as needed

#### Branch Creation Authority
**DECISION FINALIZED:** Agents can create sub-branches; Chris creates main branches
**Why this matters:** Maintains system organization while enabling agent autonomy
**Implementation:**
- Main branches (A, B, C, etc.): Created only by Chris
- Sub-branches (A-1, A-2, etc.): Created by agents as needed
- Depth limit: Maximum 2 levels (no A-1-1)
**Chris's directive:** "Agents handle sub-branches, I handle main structure"

#### Validation Script Updates
**What needs deciding:** How to update validator for trunk-branch
**Why it matters:** Current validator assumes single stream
**Requirements:**
- Check trunk updates
- Validate branch structure
- Verify context references
**Note:** Chris mentioned current validator is "bullshit" - needs rewrite

### Future Features to Consider

#### Dependency Visualization
**Purpose:** See context relationships graphically
**Implementation:** Generate graph from O-F references
**Priority:** Nice to have

#### Automated Merge Proposals
**Purpose:** Suggest when branches should merge
**Implementation:** Analyze overlap and completion
**Priority:** Later phase

#### Performance Metrics
**Purpose:** Track system efficiency
**Metrics:**
- Context reuse rate
- Update propagation time
- Conflict frequency
**Priority:** After system stable

#### Branch Templates
**Purpose:** Standardize common branch types
**Templates:**
- Feature branch template
- Bug fix branch template
- Integration branch template
**Priority:** After patterns emerge

## Quick Reference Card

### Essential Paths
```
Trunk O-F: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/1--(Trunk)_(O-F)/(Trunk)_(O-F).md
Branch A O-F: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/1--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/
Sub A-1 O-F: .../2--(A)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/2--(A-1)_(Sub_Bnch)_(O-F)/
Master Timestamp Log: 0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/(Master)_(Timestamp)_(Log).md
```

### Key Commands
```bash
# Create new branch structure
mkdir -p "0.2--(Trunk)_(Branch)_(System)/[N]--(X)_(Main_Bnch)_(O-F)/[subdirs]"

# Check for updates
diff trunk_of.md branch_of.md

# Run sync agent (when built)
python sync_agent.py --check-off-file sync_log.md
```

### Update Checklist
- [ ] Update sub-branch O-F
- [ ] Update main branch O-F
- [ ] Check if trunk update needed
- [ ] Update timestamp log
- [ ] Update work history index
- [ ] Run validator
- [ ] Prompt for git commit

### Context Sharing Checklist
- [ ] Analyze all branches for relevance
- [ ] Document what's being borrowed
- [ ] Add timestamps to imports
- [ ] Set up update monitoring
- [ ] Test with imported context
- [ ] Document dependencies

## Conclusion

The trunk-branch system is complex but necessary for scaling Fractal-RMO development. These four documents provide the complete blueprint for implementation.

**Remember:**
• Start simple with one branch
• Test thoroughly before scaling
• Document every decision
• Keep Chris in the loop

The system will evolve, but the core principles remain:
1. Trunk is truth
2. Branches isolate work
3. Context enables efficiency
4. Synchronization maintains order

Good luck building this beast! 🚀
