**Stuff to fill out for Planning_PA_Proof-o-Contcept Agent Doc Modifications**



For another agent to replicate this level of detailed explanation, they need:

Essential Context (in priority order):
1. Your complaint about Claude's explanations - The specific example you showed about lacking explanations for commands like mkdir -p {folders}
2. Your instruction style - "Explain everything like the person knows nothing about Terminal, Docker, Python, etc."
3. The original document to expand - The base Quick Start Guide or other docs
4. Examples of the detailed style - Show them 2-3 sections from my detailed version as templates

Nice but not critical:
•  The rough framework (helps understand the system but not needed for explanation task)
•  My sequential thoughts (they reveal understanding but another agent would develop their own)
•  My prompt agent framework (that's more about the CASCADE method, not needed here)

Specific prompt to give them:
"Take this document [paste original] and rewrite it with exhaustive explanations. Assume the reader knows nothing - explain what Terminal is, what each command does, what every flag means, why we're doing each step. See this example of the level of detail needed: [paste one of my detailed sections]. Every technical term needs definition, every command needs explanation, every concept needs context."

That's the minimum viable context transfer.

Initial explaination of claude not being good at explainging their shit:

Next off here:

Now this isn't a you thing - I guess its mostly a Claude thing in general, but when you Claude agents make frameworks you do it in a bitter-sweet way. Sweet because you often have some good stuff in there, but bitter because your explaination of what things are, is almost always severely lacking to the point of not being usable. Let me copy and paste something out of the quick start guide you created:


## STEP 1: Project Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone or create project directory
mkdir -p ~/CodingProjects/fractal-rmo
cd ~/CodingProjects/fractal-rmo

# Initialize git repository
git init
echo "# Fractal-RMO" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create project structure
mkdir -p {agents,core,learning,data,api,cli,tests,configs,scripts,docker}

# Create Python virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install poetry for dependency management
pip install poetry
```




Like you say things like "create python virtual environment". Then you say things # Create project structure
mkdir -p {agents,core,learning,data,api,cli,tests,configs,scripts,docker} ..... I have no clue what you're actually telling m eto do there? what does that command do? Makes no sense without an explaination.. Now that isn't saying I can't figure it out, but god damn do you ever make it harder than it needs to be with that. It isn't just this point, its in EVERY single thing. 

So to this end, I'm going to need you to write much more detailed instructions along with much more detailed explainations. Even something as simple as entering something into terminal should be stated and explained (like terminal is X found here X, you need to ____" you see?

**EXAMPLE OF GOOD EXPLAINATION**



### Start the Databases

```bash
# Go back to docker folder
cd ~/CodingProjects/fractal-rmo/docker

# Load environment variables from .env file
export $(cat ../.env | xargs)

# Start databases in background
# -d means "detached" (runs in background)
docker-compose up -d

# You should see:
# ✔ Network docker_default Created
# ✔ Container fractal_postgres Started
# ✔ Container fractal_redis Started

# Verify they're running:
docker ps
# Should show both fractal_postgres and fractal_redis as "Up"

# Check PostgreSQL logs (should show "database system is ready"):
docker logs fractal_postgres | tail -5

# Check Redis logs (should show "Ready to accept connections"):
docker logs fractal_redis | tail -5
```




**EXAMPLE #2**


```bash
# Still in agents folder
cd ~/CodingProjects/fractal-rmo/agents

# Create validator.py
cat > validator.py << 'EOF'
