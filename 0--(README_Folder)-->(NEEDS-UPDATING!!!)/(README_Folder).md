(Fractal-RMO)_(CODER) is the framework for this -> This is my best rough framework document... kinda the horse I'm betting on if any of these were to have legs... The document is composed of very rough exerpts of brainstorming sessions... thoughts near the start of the document were preliminary stages and the final brainstorm with the idea in its most advanced form is at the end

The 2--(FW)_(Analysis)_(PA) is the prompt agent I made to sort through the mess of brainstorm in my rough idea and make this thing into something tangible (FULL plan including framework)
    -Inside this you'll see 3 failed attempts of the prompt agent creation along with the fourth and final correct attempt (was having issues getting through the full 220 sequential thinking thoughts using the python wrapper (I guess it was adding tokens with the incorperated line seperator and the extra tokens reading out the filepaths and whathave you.... on the fourth one I got it to use the actual server (local) and it got through all of them)
        -This final implementation prompt agent (saved here --> /Users/chrishamlin/CodingProjects/Master_Builder/Main_Agents/MASTER_BUILDER/Fractal-RMO/VERSIONS/13--(Fractal-RMO)_(CODER)/1--(Fractal-RMO)_(CODER)/2--(FW)_(Analysis)_(PA)/4--(Final)_(Created)_(Agent)_(FRMO)_(Implementation)/4--(Final)_(Created)_(Agent)_(FRMO)_(Implementation)/4--(Final)_(Created)_(Agent)_(FRMO)_(Implementation).md at least at the time I am typing this) was designed to take the 1--(Fractal-RMO)_(CODER) rough thought framework from that into a proof of concept, taking into account a lot factors including that I'm on my own, and developing factors such as that I might need a little more guidance not being a software developer (that being said, the final version I actually switched my input around because in the other 3 failed versions it was dumbing down things too much, I changed meta prompt input to still give that information but to be sure to put it in a way that it knew I was capable somehow idk)... 
            -Anyways that agent has an output folder in the same folder that the agent folder is in. It will put all of its implementation plans in there to kick off the proof of concept of Fractal-RMO... I'll have to check its framework more closely but just from reading a few thoughts I don't think its ONLY made to implement and plan the proof of concept I think that is just our primary goal at the moment (this was also indicated in the implementation agent's input section (There is a section that asks like what stage you're developing I'm pretty sure and I put its default (meta prompt had already checked that one off for me having read my task description input to him and my rough framework ideas)... point is maybe this agent isn't just "proof of concept" implementation agent, but that's just the primary focus right now? Idk I'll have to check over his framework more closely - but yea - his output folder is in that folder too (its his and only his (the implementation agent's)).
